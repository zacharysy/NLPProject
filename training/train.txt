The Professor's map was just an ancient map    as worthless as an ice cube in the Arctic without an instrument fine enough to accurately measure longitude and latitude. You knew that the site was nearby. You dug, and you ordered the workers to dig, even without the box. As you listen to the plane and rub your aching eyes, you pray they left you supplies enough to find the pyramid and to survive, and that the plane's carrying the long overdue box.  INFIDEL Copyright 1983 by Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved. INFIDEL is a trademark of Infocom, Inc. Release 22 / Serial number 830916  Your Tent (You are in the army cot.) You are in your tent. Golden rays of the sun filter through the open tent flaps on the southern wall, but no breeze makes its way through. The dry, searing heat in the tent would be bearable if only the air stirred, even a little. At the foot of the cot is a large, unwieldy trunk. The trunk is closed and locked with a padlock.
get out of cot
You push yourself up and manage to get out of the cot. Your legs are a little wobbly, though, and your head swims.  You hear a plane flying high overhead, outside the tent.
s
Outside Your Tent You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. To the south you can see a firepit and to the north is the entrance to your tent. Everything is oddly quiet, unsettling, creating a feeling of floating anxiety. The stillness seems to enhance the eerie quality of the desert, the feeling of being truly alone. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.  You crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.
sw
Outside Supply Tent You're on a north/south path on the west edge of the encampment. Directly to the west is the supply tent, its flaps open, still in the hot, quiet air. To the east you can see the central firepit, a reminder of your being alone. A row of thickets, impossible to make any progress through even with a machete, grows along the western edge of the camp directly to the north and south of the tent. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.  You crane your neck and see a plane, high overhead, circling the encampment.
w
Supply Tent You are in a tent, very much like your own    a tent which had originally contained the supplies for your expedition. You notice, however, that most of the items which were here just yesterday have vanished with your workers. The tent looks as if it's been cleaned out and, as your stomach growls, the empty tent ironically reminds you of a turkey carcass picked clean after a huge Thanksgiving meal. Through the open tent flaps to the east you can see the firepit. If only one of the workers had remained behind, you would make him pay. Stuck in the sand, handle down, is a small pick axe. Half buried in the sand, in the corner of the tent, is a shovel.  It sounds as if the plane is circling.

se
Outside Work Tent You are on an east/west path, directly to the north of the work tent. To the north you can see the firepit and, beyond that, your tent. The work tent borders an endless vista of fine, burning sand stretching out to the south. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.  At last, your luck seems to be changing. A large crate lands right before you, its parachute flapping in the breeze. The parachute breaks away from the crate and drifts off in the wind.
s
Work Tent You are in a tent which used to house the workers and their personal effects. Looking around, taking in the stripped and bare surroundings, you feel surprised that they even left the canvas walls. You quickly realize that they took what they needed    taking everything would have been more trouble than it was worth. From the looks of things they cleared out quickly but quietly. Tacked up to the inside of one of the tent flaps is a note. Sitting in the sand, bulging a little, is a beaten up knapsack.
read note
The note reads:  Fi aman Allah!  Hereafter you shall pursue your fool dream of the hidden pyramid and its riches alone. May the jackals feed well on your bones. We have left you what you need to get back, though we hope you do not. We put several things you treasure above life itself inside your trunk, locked with your precious padlock, but we could not bear to part with the key. Especially after what you said of our rites. We hope the drug we placed in your drink did you harm. If not, we are at least satisfied you slept especially soundly while we cleaned out the camp.  Farewell

(wearing it) You swing the knapsack over your shoulders and it settles on your back as its cover flap closes.

Outside Work Tent Lying in the sand is a wooden packing crate.
n
Fire Pit You are in the center of the encampment, standing before a charred pit, a hole dug in the sand surrounded by blackened rocks. The night breezes have already started the reclamation work of the desert, covering most of the pit's bottom. You can see your tent to the north, the work tent to the south, and the supply tent to the west. Far off to the east, through the heat waves rising off the shifting sands, you can see gentle, rolling dunes. There's an enlarged hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts. Half covered with sand is a bright piece of foil which catches your eye. Sitting by a rock is what looks like a matchbook.

Near the Nile You are on an east/west path on the north side of the encampment. A path to the south starts here, and you can see the riverbank clearly to the west. A warm, light breeze reaches your face, drying your sweat into a thin mask of salt. You glance to the north and are greeted by a disheartening sight: an endless stretch of searing desert. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
w
River Bank You are on the bank of the river Nile. The shoreline is sandy and cool, and reeds wave in a light but warm breeze. Directly to the north and the south thickets make strolling along the bank impossible. You're hot, and the cool rippling water to the west looks inviting, but you're not alone in that thought    crocodiles bask on the west bank, eyeing you hungrily, just waiting for you to enter their watery domain. Things were never like this when Craige was around.

Northern Path You are on an east/west path on the northern side of the encampment. To the east you can see the sites of previous excavations your workers had begun before they deserted you. Low, gentle sand dunes roll out of sight to the north, but your camp's eastern border has a path, heading off to the south, which starts here. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
se
Desert You are in the desert, still within sight of the encampment, just a tiny oasis to the west. The tents, shimmering behind the heat waves rising from the sand, seem to be calling you back, beckoning, offering safety and refuge. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.
se
Desert You are in the desert, out of sight of the encampment. You are thankful there's no wind, even though a cooling breeze would be welcomed, since the fine sand particles would sting your face and hands. All around is the desert, a sweeping expanse of disheartening sand. There's a small hole in the sand, a remnant of your excavation attempts.

The ancient stones beneath your feet shake and tremble as they move the sands. You leap out of the way and manage to avoid being sucked down into the vortex. Through the sands, an entrance down into the pyramid is revealed. The entire experience sends a jolt of adrenaline through your body as your lips form a sneer. You've found it. And without any help from those idiots.
d
Chamber of Ra You are standing in the Chamber of Ra, a tribute to the Sun God. Even though the only natural light enters through the opening above, the room is brilliantly lit as though the walls themselves generated light. The room slopes inward and the walls meet at an open point, over your head. The heat of the desert filters down through the opening and, as the air slowly circulates, the deep, long dead musty odors from the depths of the pyramid assault your senses. Four staircases descend from here: a steep one to the north, a winding one to the south, a wide one to the east, and a narrow one to the west. In the center of the room is a large red sandstone altar mounted solidly in the floor. Lying on the floor, partially covered with dust, is a small pink alabaster jar. Leaning against the altar is a bronze torch.

(down the winding staircase) South Landing You are on a landing in the middle of a set of stairs. The staircase goes down to the south and up to the north. The walls here are undistinguished, formed by the stones of which the pyramid was built. Your match went out. And it burned your fingers, too! You drop it. The match falls into a crack in the stone floor.
s
Narrow Hallway You are at the entrance of a narrow hallway which goes to the northeast. A staircase goes up to the north.

Narrow Hallway You are at a bend in the Narrow Hallway. The hallway continues to the northwest and to the southwest. Inscribed on the wall are some hieroglyphs.
nw
Barge Chamber You are in the southern section of a huge room which holds the royal barge. Before you, to the north, is a plank which provides entrance to the barge. There is room to move around the barge to the east and west, while a doorway to the southeast leads into a darkened corridor.
w
Barge Chamber You're in the southwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can still see the barge entrance to the east, while there's enough room to continue to the north, around the barge.
n
Barge Chamber You're in the northwest corner of the Barge Chamber. You can see by your light that there's room enough to continue around the back of the barge by going to the east, while you can bypass the bow of the boat by going south.
e
Barge Chamber You're at the start of a hallway which goes off to the north. To the south, directly behind you, is the back side of the barge. There's enough room to get around it to the east and west.
n
Steep Passageway You are at the top of a steep, descending passage that plunges down to the north. Although the angle is steep, it looks as if you should have firm enough footing to travel safely. From the angle, it appears as though the passage is actually leaving the pyramid, cutting down through the sand high overhead to an adjoining building.
n
Steep Passageway You are about midway down a steep, descending, north/south passageway which seems to lead out of the pyramid to the north. The walls of stone are polished and as smooth as glass, glistening in your light, lighting the passage far to the north and the south.
n
Steep Passageway You are at the north end of a descending passageway. You can see the smoothly polished passageway rising up and out of sight to the south, heading back into the pyramid. A large doorway cut into the stone walls lies to the north and, through it, you can see an immense chamber.
n
Temple Chamber You are in a huge chamber, immense in its size and scope, especially since it is far underground. Your light seems to climb and fall from the high walls, making their top boundaries undefined as they melt into inky darkness, flickering into the unknown reaches high overhead. There is a huge doorway carved out of the south wall, the arch at its top barely discernible in your light. To the north is a similar doorway, slightly scaled down, with pillars on either side of it, their shadows playing strange tricks on the wall behind them. You can just barely make out the paintings on the walls, pictures of the ancient Queen, her servants, and the priests in attendance.
n
Inner Chamber You are in the temple's inner chamber. The ceiling here is lower, low enough for your light to reach it. There are openings in the east and west walls, and a large, arched doorway to the south. The walls are covered with paintings, most of which depict the Queen in different stages of preparation for her trip on the royal barge. One in particular, larger than any of the others, shows the Queen and all of her attendants aboard the barge, floating through the air on their way to the netherworld. There are some detailed hieroglyphs on one of the walls. Lying before you in tortured repose are the bony remains of a former adventurer, someone who tried looting the pyramid long, long ago. As you bend over to pay your respects, something glitters, catching your eye as you move your head.
w
Golden Room You are in a room whose walls are covered with gold leaf. Your light reflects off the walls with a rich, warm tone and reveals the outlines of hieroglyphics engraved in the gold itself. There is a doorway cut into the south wall and, through the reflected light, you can tell it leads into a small chamber. There is another doorway leading out to the east.
s
Golden Alcove You are in a small alcove off the Golden Room. Sitting in the middle of this small room is a roughly hewn slab of granite, much like a legless table. Sitting in the middle of the granite table is a gleaming chalice made of gold.

Center of Barge You are standing on the deck of an ancient wooden barge. Before you, cut into the deck, is a hole. To the south is a plank which leads down off the barge. You can see two cabins on the deck, one to the west and the other to the east. Before you, running down through a hole in the deck, is a sturdy beam made of wood. Although only a few feet of it rise above the deck, it was probably used at one time as a mast.
w
Fore Cabin You are in the forward cabin aboard the barge. The cabin is bare with none of the luxuries you expected to see. You close your eyes for a moment, picturing the barge you'll someday own, the yacht fully rigged and crewed. You open your eyes and shake your head, anxious to make your dream reality. There's a doorway to the east leading out onto the deck. Sitting on the deck is a papyrus scroll.

West End of Hold You are in the westmost portion of the hold, below the deck of the barge. On the north side of the hull is a small knothole about three feet off the deck. Overhead you can see a hole going through the deck while, directly below this hole, on the deck by your feet, is a slot. Coming down through the hole above your head and ending in the slot at your feet is the beam which served as a mast.

(down the rope) Circular Room You are in a strange, round room which sits in the center of four hallways. These hallways lead off to the northeast, southeast, southwest and northwest like the spokes of a wheel. Above your head is a long tunnel which stretches up and out of sight. Descending from above is the end of a long rope. As you peer down the dimly lit hallways, you see that the doors in all four hallways are balanced halfway open. A large golden cluster sits on the floor. Sitting in the middle of the floor is a large statue, about two feet shorter than you. It reminds you a little of Miss Ellingsworth.

Room of Selkis You are standing in a small room, that of the protective goddess Selkis.

The darkest tiles border the floor, and become lightest near the ceiling. On one wall, inscribed in a beaten gold panel, is the symbol of Selkis, under which you can see some hieroglyphic text. An opening through the southwest wall leads out of this room. A beautiful ruby cluster, sparkling like fire, sits on the floor.

Room of Isis This is the room of the protective goddess Isis. You stand in amazement in the center of the room as thousands of tiny lights twinkle around you. With great surprise you realize that the light from your torch is being reflected by the mirror like surfaces of innumerable quartzite chips. These are set artfully into red clay panels in the walls, and are surrounded by shiny red jasper fragments. On the southwest wall, under the winged symbol of Isis, some hieroglyphic text is inscribed in a gold panel. To the northeast is an arched opening, and, looking through it, you can barely make out a hallway. Lying on the ground is a brilliant, glowing emerald cluster.

Turning Passage You are in a strange, turning passageway. The floor here descends, reminding you of a ramp Craige once told you about    a deep entrance into the depths of an Incan tomb. The ramp turns off toward the north. Judging from what you remember of the cube rooms, the ramp most probably passes beneath the ascending east staircase. Through the open doorway to the west you can still see one of the cube rooms.
n
Top of Stairway You are at the top of a sixteen step stairway. It leads west and down. The strange passageway into the cube rooms lies to the south. The walls here are painted in somber colors    deep ochres, browns and blacks, but the scenes the paintings depict are oddly gay. Priests smile, their hands lifted up high to Amun Ra, offering flower petals in their palms, while a young girl, bedecked in black, stands by watching, a twisted smile on her face.
d
Bottom of Stairs You are at the bottom of the sixteen step stairway. The stairway goes up to the east, while to the west is solid plaster. Painted on the plaster are some hieroglyphs.

Narrow Passageway You have reached the west end of the passage. Before you is a door surrounded by a heavy timber frame. The door is entirely blocked up with plaster. Toward the bottom of the north wall and the south wall, about three inches off the floor, are two small niches. There are some hieroglyphs on the plaster.

The plaster chips fly from the door as the incessant tapping of your pick axe does its work.

Antechamber You are in the middle of the Chamber of Eternal Royalty, the antechamber. The walls in this section of the antechamber are covered with beveled tiles of deep blue lapis lazuli and pink alabaster. At ceiling height, on the west wall, are paintings depicting the marriage of the goddess Isis and the god Osiris. The Antechamber stretches out to the north and the south. There's just enough light cast for you to see the outline of the bottomless pit in the passage to the east. Through the doorway you can see the beam spanning the pit.

Annex You are in the Chamber of Rebirth, the Annex. As you gaze about this small room, strange kohl rimmed eyes gaze back at you from the painted figures which cover all of the walls. There are scenes of a great procession, with white clad princesses offering gifts of precious oils and papyri to the mummified figure of the Queen. Bastet, the cat goddess, holds the mummy erect. Above you, painted on the ceiling, is the image of Tueris, the hippopotamus goddess. The only way out is through the doorway to the east. Wedged between the doorway, from side to side, is the stout beam. Sitting in the middle of this room is a huge stone slab. Around its side runs a seam which is barely detectable. On top of the slab are four round holes, one in each corner.

Antechamber You are in the north end of the Chamber of Eternal Royalty. On the eastern and western walls are scenes carved in high relief depicting a royal figure, possibly meant to represent a new ruler, performing the ritual of the "opening of the mouth and eyes", the ceremony of restoring to the mummy of the departed Queen the use of its senses. The north wall of this area is a thick, solid wall of stone. In the center of this wall is a timber lintel on top of a doorway.

Burial Chamber You have entered the Chamber of Departure Towards the Funeral Destinies, the Burial Chamber. There is a doorway leading into a small room off to the east. In the middle of the chamber, stretching almost from wall to wall, is a huge, ancient sarcophagus. Its cover is composed of pure quartz and through the shining light you can see the golden, gleaming mummiform coffin. There is a small recess and a large recess on the top of the cover which you can make out as thin, outlined areas. Four statues surround the sarcophagus, one in each corner: Isis, Nephthys, Neith and Selkis. Their outstretched arms clamp down tightly on the quartz cover. Wedged under the top of the doorway, perpendicular to the floor, is the wooden beam.

Treasury You are in the Chamber of Reconstitution of the Body, the Treasury. To the west is a doorway leading back into the Burial Chamber. In the room is a large, granite table. Cut out from the top of this table are three circles of polished granite. The left disc is empty, and it is one inch above the top of the table. Sitting on the middle disc is a scarab, and the middle disc is slightly below the top of the table. The right disc is empty, and it is one inch above the top of the table.

Shadow Armory Shadows gather around you. For a moment, dregs of light defined by the negative space take on the shapes of maple leaf, kite, comb, and other shapes that flicker across the walls too rapidly for you to interpret.  Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas reliefs spiral upward.  Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.
x light
Here the light, apparently sourceless, adirectional, takes on a burnished quality.
x leaf
Autumn is the maple's season, when all things die but fire and sun, pine and moon, last guardians before the door into winter and winter's snowlocked court. Once you knew a dark haired woman who always wore red, gold and black, the maple's colors, even at the emperor's winter court, steadfast against the encroaching fashions of indigo or palest blue. She had a low ironic laugh, but she is lost to you....   Here, surrounded by stone, shadow, light, there is no indication of the season.
x kite
There should be two kites, not one: brothers and sisters fly them as pairs during the kite fighting auguries of spring. Alas, no wind stirs in this dustless place.

The comb has the curved, tortoise shell shape that you have seen in years past  but is one of the teeth broken?

Weapons line the walls, writ in shadow  yet you know their heft and balance, the patterns of movement that make one deadly in attack and another impenetrable in defense. If only you knew, as well, the histories of blood, patronage and betrayal  or loyalty  that they represent.  One of the weapons is more substantial than you realized at first, a bronze hilted dagger with a tassel hanging from the pommel.

The shapes of light you saw as you entered fade irrevocably.   Undying Garden Barren branches and pines suggest winter's quiet. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.  A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.  Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.  You can see a tortoise shell comb here.

The compass is carved from a single piece of jade in which violet and green intermingle delicately; the cardinal directions  if such they be  are marked by hawk, swallow, crane and feather. More curiously still, the needle is of glass, suggesting that it homes to something other than the north. Perhaps you can set it yourself?  The needle points to the feather.

Even for the emperor's winter court, the only birds that remain in the gardens are the jeweled nightingales, which sing dainty mechanical tunes when they are stroked with a feather. Your brother hated them passionately, but he listened to them readily enough whenever the justiciar asked, with that smile that lit her eyes, though it never reached her mouth.
x hawk
It was autumn when last you went hawking with the emperor's justiciar. Freed of court robes, she soared as surely as the kestrel that raced before her; her hair was black and scandalously unbound as the red and gold ribbons tore away in the wind to land in your waiting hand. Autumn...

Spring is the swallows' season, when they return from their sojourn in distant lands and signal the kite flying auguries. If only an augury could help you now...

The most auspicious of all birds, save the imperial phoenix. Many a summer morning have you gazed upon cranes in flight, whether silhouetted against the setting sun or set in abalone shell upon a fine lacquered cabinet, a cloisonne hairpin.

Undying Garden Autumn's fiery colors are evident in the trees and flowers around you. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.  A jade compass rests at the garden's metaphysical center, between translucence and opacity, curve and line, and other dichotomies too subtle for your eye. A gentle warmth from the surface invites touch.  Transactions of light show other rooms southward and westward.  On the unliving trees is a folded maple leaf.
x trees
Maples in black, red and gold, like the colors she loved so well, and the cloven yellow of gingko. A single maple leaf flutters loosely, as though seeking escape.

This cleverly folded leaf stirs as though, in its secret paper dreams, it yearns to fly.

More remarkable than the fan's intricate designs is the long blue tassel that trails from it. It is the kind of fan a lady might carry to cool herself during the summer's heat.
cut blue tassel
A few neat cuts free some strands from the tassel, and tying them together results in  a kitestring?  For a second there is a dark eyed boy beside you, whose laugh is yours, but wilder; whose smile is yours, but wider. If only you remembered the augury that you and your brother cast that spring in the kite flying ritual, years before either of you met the woman who wore black and red and gold...

fly kite
Spring: the season of augury. Red and black and gold, maple colors, kite colors; you no longer know which. A breeze stirs through the room, though the trees and flowers are no more affected by it than they would be by the sun's earnest light or a plague of locusts. Nevertheless, you hear the hollow sound of something being dislodged from one of the trees.  It was spring when your kite and your brother's became too entangled for one glass edged string to cut the other's, for one to conquer the other, though entangled they flew yet; and spring when you were first parted from your brother on his first campaign and yours, two fatherless boys entering the emperor's service as adults.   The kite tugs from your hand, as impatient as a hawk winning free of hood; dances perilously upward upon the wings of this nowhere breeze; and disappears.   The breeze swells to a gale that rears southward and upward, seeking the sky in this enclosed and skyless room.

Shadow Armory Curiously, the only weapons here live amid light and cannot be worn: they are silhouettes flung against the walls. Stairs carved with bas reliefs spiral upward.  Northward and westward lie passageways unhindered by door or folding screen.  A wind gallops toward the stairs, seeking the sky.

Moonlit Chamber Moonlight diffuses through the walls, tracing out unreadable sigils in calligraphies of light and dark. Upwards, the sky is open to your eyes. Stairs adorned with bas relief motifs spiral downward.  Wind flings itself up the walls and toward the sky; you have but to look up.

The night spreads her wings above you, and shows no sign of welcoming her sister of the sunborn day. Constellations jewel the sky, half hidden by clouds like nestling feathers: the Heavenly Horse and the Imperial Chrysanthemum.

The star stallion rears like the chargers you once rode. The justiciar herself preferred such spirited mounts.

It is the first among constellations, open to the eyes of all people unlike the emperor himself. You and your brother saw him only once, when he called on you to stand together for your family's name.

Undying Garden Spring's blossoms and budding trees are here in profusion. Metal and wood, painted and sculpted, the false garden is heedless of harvest, drought or rain.

Skeletal Banquet It seems this is a banquet room, if a banquet had no especial place for people to dine. Glassware and stoneware are arranged in deliberate shapes, as though they are constellations.   South lies a chamber of brooding silence, and a vague, sweet fragrance comes from the east. Stairs of blackest marble lead downward.  On the table are a banquet of bones and some ivory chopsticks.
x bones
The feast before you seems a mockery, for everywhere upon the plates and bowls there is nothing but skeletons artfully pieced together to create grotesqueries from ordinary game. A creature half bird, half rabbit, for one, or a pheasant with extra legs. Yet it is perhaps no more grotesque than some of the intrigues that poisoned the emperor's court, at times.
get bones with chopsticks
(first taking the ivory chopsticks) Bone calls to bone, it seems, for the skeletal feast flees no more. With great care you disentangle the bones and piece them back together in a more seemly fashion. Despite some puzzling conjunctions of joints, you discover that interlocking skeletons of dragon and phoenix form the centerpiece.  In a battle older than bone, says one story, the dragon and phoenix were brothers, both born of fire; but one ascended to burn in splendor, and the other clothed himself in lightning tongue and storm rains. The phoenix must die, but is ever reborn; the dragon lives no more, but never dies.
d
As your feet meet that first step, a sudden vertigo overtakes you, as though you journeyed through skies beyond imagining, across hollow and infinite distances. You emerge back where you started: it seems the night's hold is too strong here, and you must find some guide star to anchor your way.
x arrangement
The arrangement is in the shape of the constellation called the White Archer, who shot the Sun out of the sky and wanders the night in penance. It seems a curiously ill fortuned constellation for an ill fortuned feast, and almost any other arrangement would be more auspicious.
set constellations to horse
The Moon is the horse that bears the White Archer's messages to his lover the Sun, returning to rove the night's passages with him. The Heavenly Horse, though, is a messenger that submits to no rider, like the justiciar with her dark, proud eyes. It seems a strangely fitting sign for a stranger's feast.

Hall of Hawks Memory overtakes you as you enter: you and your brother speaking to each other in low, tense voices (not shouting, never shouting before her) until the justiciar bids you leave, curtly. The next day, when the emperor stripped her of her rank, and neither you nor your brother had the influence to free her from the court's machinations  you have lived that day over and over, more than any man ought.  Hawks painted in gold and brown soar along the walls. It is strangely warm here, as though fires lived just beyond your perception. The entire hall is open to the wind and warmth, unobstructed except by your presence.  Stairs of darkest marble circle upward. A passageway leads south into clear, colorless light.
x hawks
A splendor of hawks in flight, each feather meticulously painted. Each one has a woman's dark eyes instead of a raptor's golden gaze.

As you approach, you realize that the shadows split the passageway in a terrible clean fracture, and your face aches unbearably; only when you move away does the pain ease.
wear mask
Suddenly and disturbingly inspired by the riven passage to the south, you lift the mask to your face, momentarily shadowing your vision. When you can see clearly again, the mask has been rejoined flawlessly  and the shadows close around the passageway. Yours is the dragon's perfection, the dark journey skyward, as you have chosen.

Passage of Storms Cherry blossoms and lilacs, kite flying auguries and newly budding leaves: the trappings of spring are far beneath you now, though the kite is a red speck dancing in the storm. The moonlit tower lays open beneath you, as though stones were no more than the barest skeleton, the merest shadow. Lightning and storm clouds gather around you, and in the sky above the Moon gallops beyond your reach to the horizon.

It is night, now and always, with the storm clouds and lightning your constant companions.

Revision number 86 / Serial number 840320  "John, snap out of it!" cries Tip Randall, bursting into your private laboratory. "The alert signal's flashing on your videophone!" As you look up from your top secret plans for the SCIMITAR, a submarine designed to capture marine life on the ocean floor and still being tested, you notice the alarm bell on the videophone ringing. Someone's trying to reach you over the private videophone network of Inventions Unlimited!  (lab center) You're at your workbench in the center of your private laboratory, a small part of the Wayne Research Lab in the town of Frobton. The videophone screen looms overhead, with its alarm bell ringing. Tip is here. A microphone is sitting on your workbench.  Okay, John, what do you want to do now?

The Computestor is ready for questions.
ask computestor about videophone
"Symptoms: no picture, no sound.  Possible causes: 1) Failure of the transmitter at source. 2) A short in the undersea coaxial cable linking transmitter to the Wayne Research Lab, if signal is coming from Aquadome. 3) Satellite malfunction or sunspot interference if transmitter is at earth's surface. 4) Failure of the video receiver. 5) Overload in the Electrical Panel (circuit breaker popped). 6) Sabotage (circuit breaker open)."

(Kemp's office) You're in the office of your lab assistant, Sharon Kemp. There is a desk and chair here, and a door leading out to the parking lot. To the west, a hallway leads back to your lab.  Tip follows you into Kemp's office. As you enter, Sharon is hastily going through the contents of an open file drawer. She turns with a somewhat startled expression as you appear in the doorway. Her face is flushed and her manner seems slightly emotional.

The test tank (which is now empty of sea water) is located in a large work room, just south of your private laboratory, with concrete block walls on three sides and a high metal roof. Most of its floor is dug out and lined with steel, to form the huge tank used for developing and testing underwater gear and the pilot models of your submarine craft. There's a walkway around the tank on three sides    north, west and south. On the east side, a steel gate forms the wall of the room.  Tip follows you into the north walkway.

"I wanted to make sure the Aquadome sonar equipment would warn us if the Snark approached again. I was worried because the blips on the scope looked fuzzy, as if the system was out of alignment. When I inspected it, I found someone had secretly attached this device to it!" Zoe takes a small "black box" device from her desk drawer.

Okay, the black box is now open.

After a brief study of the circuitry, you deduce its purpose: it was designed to change the sonar output so the ultrasonic pulses make a more complex pattern (for example BURPETY BURP B'DURP) instead of just a simple, clear cut BURP. This would also make fuzzier blips.

ask tip about grid
"If the Snark stays near the sea floor, John, it may churn up silt. Even with our brass search light on, we might have trouble aiming a weapon. Wouldn't it be easier if we could spot its exact position by sonar?"
yes
"John, our sonarscope shows each sea square as 500 meters across. A blip indicates the APPROXIMATE position of an object. That's not good enough to hit the broad side of a barn! Let me install a fine grid on the sonarscope that'll show a blip's position to within 5 meters, okay?"
yes
"John, I checked the storage room and found a fine grid that'll fit our sonarscope. I can install it quickly! I'll have someone install a fine throttle control, too, for tight maneuvering. It has the same 3 settings, but for small sea squares    0, 5, 10, or 15 meters per turn."Mick Antrim reports back from the docking tank, looking somewhat puzzled. "John, I ran the hydrojet on full, but it didn't overheat. The voltage regulator PROBABLY got out of adjustment and overcharged the lasers, but it seems okay now. Just to be safe, I installed a new voltage regulator. Want me to shut down the hydrojet till you're ready?"
yes
Tip flashes you a meaningful glance. Mick's reaction may be all you need to prove he's NOT the traitor. But you'll have to decide for yourself.  Mick Antrim turns away, then stops and says: "John, there's no Emergency Survival Unit under your seats in the SCIMITAR. I hear you plan a new type of unit for the Ultramarine Bioceptor. But the standard unit will fit, and we have one in the storage room. Would you like one installed, just in case? Bill Greenup and Amy Lowell could do it in a few minutes. Shall I tell 'em to?"

Infocom interactive fiction Copyright (c) 1986 by Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved. Release 97 / Serial number 851218  As you trudge along in the wake of the outflowing crowd, you thumb through your memories of this evening. Your experience of the circus, with its ballyhooed promises of wonderment and its ultimate disappointment, has been to sink your teeth into a candy apple whose fruit is rotten.  Never mind the outrageous prices, the Mt. Everest vantage point, the communistically long lines, the audience more savage than the lion act. And it wasn't the shabbiness of the performances themselves that's got you soured on Spangleland. No, instead it's that the circus is a reminder of your own secret irrational desire to steal the spotlight, to defy death, and to bask in the thunder of applause.  In the Wings The big top can be entered to the north and exited to the south. To the northeast, the grandstand begins its precipitous rise.
s
You emerge into the warm night air of summer.  Connection This area of matted down crabgrass lies between the vaulted big top entrance to the north and the enticements of the midway to the east, where a sagging banner hangs crookedly above a turnstile. There is a drinking fountain near the side wall of the tent. You can enter the night to the west and south.  The last of the crowd just now trickles eastward through the turnstile.  A midget decked out in a Russian general's uniform is standing before the drinking fountain.

Once elevated, Comrade Thumb slurps his fill of water. He then plops down, gives you a quick salute, and waddles off into the darkness.

Beside the Big Top You're standing next to the big top, which is gently flapping in the warm breeze.  A cheap plastic clown mask, having been carelessly dropped here, is lying face up on the ground.  About waist high, a barred passage for wild animals extends several yards out from the big top.

s
Back Yard You're standing in front of the turnstile entrance to a fenced in area, which is south. To the west stands a droopy tent, and the field continues north and east.  A tall and lanky clown in baggy pants trudges out of the tent and toward the turnstile. Comrade Thumb follows behind.  Adjacent to the turnstile to your south is a vertical cage.

Inside Prop Tent This dimly lighted tent houses a ragtag collection of outrageous props and wacky devices, including a midget automobile that's garaged in here.  Lying here in a heap is a gorilla suit.  President William Howard Taft is here.  You can hear muffled voices coming from outside and see two ominous shadows cast against the side wall of the tent.

You crouch behind the cardboard character.  From behind the figure of President Taft you hear footsteps enter the tent, a pause, then hushed conversation.
listen to conversation
"So, Munrab, what is it? Why have you called me here?"    "Listen, Detective, I've had a terrible day in your lousy little town, so let me be brief. Receipts have been down all month, tonight's concession stand sales were especially small, the towners were tightfisted, they nearly leveled my grandstand, and on top of that somebody's kidnapped my daughter, Chelsea. That's where you come in. Here's the most recent picture of her    a pretty good likeness in my opinion."  "Mr. Munrab, why are we whispering?"
again
"I don't know, because it's a mystery I guess. Anyhow, it's not because I suspect any of my own people here on the lot." There's a pause. "I've got a pretty loyal crew here. Sure, I work the guys a fair amount, but hey, no one joins the circus expecting a holiday."  Lacking all passion and professionalism, the detective replies, "I'll suspect who you want me to suspect. You're paying the bill."  "Here, see, the language of this ransom note clearly shows that it's not an inside job. Detective, I don't know what kind of crazies are running loose in this town, but I'm afraid harm might come to my daughter if the police were to show up. God knows this circus doesn't need that kind of publicity, anyway. So I'm relying on you and you alone."  "I'd better hold on to that note, Munrab."  "Alright, then get going."  You can hear Mr. Munrab and the detective hustle out of the tent. You stand up.

Near White Wagon You are standing on a gentle upslope of the grassy field, next to a rather imposing trailer whose door is closed to the east. In dark panorama, the field continues north and west    and south, where a large banner has been erected.  Part of a narrow pole is sticking out from under the wagon.

Performance Ring This is the arena's oval shaped performance ring which appears deathly quiet without its circus atmosphere. Also missing is its safety net. A rope ladder dangles to within a foot of the ground.  Just west lies the entrance to a large, round cage that completely encircles the second of the two rings. To the south the big top's vaulted wing leads out into the open air. The arena's rickety grandstands rise steeply north and east.

Clown Alley The gut of the trailer exposes the underside of circus life    grungy costumes strewn about, crooked and cracked mirrors, the musty odor of fresh makeup mingled with clown sweat infusing the air.  Against the wall is a row of cramped looking bunks, and running from the floor to one upper bunk is a small ladder. You can see an ash tray sitting on the lower bunk.  Chuckles the clown is leaning in front of a mirror, removing his makeup.  Sitting on an upper bunk, with his arms folded and legs swinging, is Comrade Thumb.

Andrew impulsively snatches the cigarette case from you.   "Aha!" squeals Jenny, as she seems to recollect more details of Andrew's dirty dealings. "And you're supposed to meet later on with your fellow thugs at Katz's trailer, the big brute. Well you can just forget about it, Andrew!"  There ensues a hurly burly struggle between the opposing personalities trapped within the one body. Jenny chases Andrew out of the sideshow amid shrieks of rage which echo down the midway.

Near White Wagon You are standing on a gentle upslope of the grassy field, next to a rather imposing trailer whose door is closed to the east. Attached to the rear of the trailer is a stepladder. In dark panorama, the field continues north and west    and south, where a large banner has been erected.  There is an elephant sized hole in the fence to the northeast.

You'd think that the Timelords would be pleased that you were not only responsible for discovering that Morbius' brain had been secretly kept alive, but that you were instrumental in destroying the revived villian.  Do they offer you their gratitude?  No, they merely point out that you left the Brain of Morbius on Karn and demand that you retrieve it and bring it back to Gallifrey.  That's gratitude for you.  However, as you value your own freedom, you really don't have much choice but to do as the Timelords request.

Bottom of Cliff You're at the bottom of a cliff that towers menacingly above you, merging with the murky sky above.  A narrow cleft runs into the cliff base to the east.  You can see the battered remains of a hideously disfigured creature at the base of the cliff.
x creature
You recognize this corpse to be the battered remains of the body created for Morbius's brain by the brilliant but insane neurologist Solon. It's a horrific conglomeration of the parts of several different creatures. Quite unattractive.  Instead of a head, however, there is a plastic globe which acted as an artificial brain case.
x globe
It's a transparent plastic globe, rather like a fish bowl.  When Morbius' brain was housed in it, you could almost read his thoughts.  Only now do you suddenly notice the absence of the brain within the case!  You search around the base of the cliff, but find no sign of the brain of Morbius.  Looking inside the globe, you notice that the nerves which connected the grotesque body to the brain have been carefully severed with a laser cutter.  Somebody has been here before you and stolen Morbius' brain!

Ledge The trail ends here at a rather small ledge which overlooks a precipitous drop of about 30 feet.  Be careful not to lose your footing here.  Looking downwards, you are surprised to see what looks like a flying saucer parked below you.  You suspect that whoever took the Brain of Morbius is in that saucer.  You can only safely move back down the sloping trail to the south.  A signpost has been erected here.

It is with great hope and expectation I send you on this mission," the Grand Inquisitor intones, his voice booming like distant, rumbling thunderheads. "We have discovered what appears to be a piece of the Great Underground Empire, never before explored. I would have sent Grubald the Bold, but he's busy. As is Matchlick the Mighty. So, 'tis you."  "What of Linklaw the Lucky?" you ask shyly.  "Laid up. I'm afraid 'tis you and none other. A simple, solo quest, one of fun and mirth, mischief and merriment, a jaunt, an excursion, a simple outing. Merely explore, enjoy yourself, and bring back news of what lies there, long ago buried for countless ages."  "And Fretsham the Fortunate?" you ask hopefully.  "A fatality!" the Inquisitor booms. "Here," he says with evaporating patience, "take these and be of good cheer." He thrusts into your hands two things: a brass lantern of dubious quality; and a plastic sword of no antiquity or use whatsoever.  "But what of Kolchack the   "  "Enough! Kolchack is contracted. Remember, who is the boss of you!"  He pauses briefly as if awaiting a reply. Then without warning, he answers his own question. "Me! I am the boss of you! Now begone!"  And with that, you embark on...  Zork: The Undiscovered Underground, a text adventure prequel to Zork Grand Inquisitor Copyright 1997 by Activision Inc. Written by Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, programmed by Gerry Kevin Wilson. Release 16 / Serial number 970828 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0  New Excavation You are standing at the entrance of a narrow, waist high tunnel that winds out of sight to the northeast. This, you have been told, is the entrance to the newfound areas of the Great Underground Empire. In your left hand hangs a rather unconvincing replica of the traditional adventurer's brass lantern. In the other is an ersatz Elvish sword of no antiquity whatsoever. Its plastic blade, dull as a bread knife, barely reflects the lantern's dim and uneven glow.
ne
As you enter the tunnel, you feel a slight rumble beneath your crepe soled boots. As you turn to look back up to the exit, giant, translucent boulders begin to fall from the walls and ceiling. You duck and cover your head    when the dust clears, you feel your heart sink in your chest. You are trapped!  Tunnel You are in a narrow tunnel whose entrance has been blocked by gigantic, translucent boulders. Your only option is to continue to the northeast, where the tunnel gradually widens.

The boulders are, in reality, milky white crystals and fairly regular in shape, like giant diamonds.

Cultural Complex This imposing ante room, the center of what was apparently the cultural center of the GUE, is adorned in the ghastly style of the GUE's "Grotesque Period."  With leering gargoyles, cartoonish friezes depicting long forgotten scenes of GUE history, and primitive statuary of pointy headed personages unknown (perhaps very, very distant progenitors of the Flatheads), the place would have been best left undiscovered. North of here, a large hallway passes under the roughly hewn inscription "Convention Center."  To the east, under a fifty story triumphal arch, a passageway the size of a large city boulevard opens into the Royal Theater. A relatively small and unobtrusive sign (perhaps ten feet high) stands nearby. South, a smaller and more dignified (i.e. post Dimwit) path leads into what is billed as the "Hall of Science."
n
Convention Center Lobby You are standing at the entrance of the GUE Convention Center. On the floor, you can see occasional splotches of paint through the grime and dust. Although the whole cultural center appears to have been long abandoned, loud, low pitched sounds emanate from the door standing open to the north. And while these sounds most closely approximate those made by under lubricated granola fabricators, they nonetheless fill you with dread. Next to the door is a sign, and to the sign's left (northwest to you) is a souvenir stand. The cultural center's lobby lies to the south.
nw
Souvenir Stand You find yourself standing in front of a souvenir stand that is clearly affiliated with the Convention Center. An odd looking salesman sits behind the counter, his head resting on his hand and his eyes glued to a spot somewhere above and behind you (a quick, frightened glance over your shoulder reveals nothing eye catching; indeed, nothing at all.) A notice on the counter points toward a small, curtained room to the north.  On the counter are four candy bars (a Baby Rune, a Multi Implementeers, a ZM$100000 and a Forever Gores), some popcorn, some postcards and a chicken finger.  You can see a salesman here.
talk to man
Although not much of a conversationalist, the salesman leans forward to listen.  Two things are immediately obvious: 1) He is not a regular user of toothpaste or mouthwash and 2) He is obviously wearing a mask.
take mask
With the salesman's hot, fetid breath threatening to exfoliate multiple layers of facial epidermis, you quickly pull the mask from his face. In hellish harmony, two terrifying screams fill the air: yours, as the first human to see a grue; and his, as prelude to a graphic demonstration of why it is that they aren't seen by light of day (to wit: spontaneous grueish combustion, leaving only a greasy slick on the ground by your feet.) Although you will spend the rest of your life trying to forget what you have just seen, the sight of that sickly glowing fur, fish mouthed face and razor like fingers remains forever etched in your mind. You throw the mask away in horror at what you've just seen.  [Your score has just gone up by eight points.]

Changing Room It is obvious from the array of body suits, masks, and gloves heaped on the ground, that this is a changing room, and not a very comfortable one at that. No chairs, tables, hooks, hangers, or shelves here: just the costumes themselves, each piece more hideous than the last. A mirror hangs opposite the curtain through which you entered.  You can see eight pairs of gloves (a pair of hairy gloves, a pair of spiked gloves, a pair of bloody gloves, a pair of stumpy gloves, a pair of blistered gloves, a pair of scaly gloves, a pair of razor like gloves and a pair of suction cupped gloves), eight masks (a slimy mask, a pock marked mask, a four eyed mask, a decomposing mask, a fish mouthed mask, a lizard like mask, a fungus like mask and a humanoid mask) and eight body suits (a gelatinous body suit, a feathered body suit, a glowing/fur covered body suit, a rainbow striped body suit, an armor plated body suit, a sponge like body suit, a blood oozing body suit and a semi transparent body suit) here.

You glide casually in, gurgling in loud, guttural tones; better still, the fish mouthed mask is somehow providing a small amount of vision in the darkness. Two nearby grues ask if you are suffering from allergies (apparently, human dandruff levels are above normal for this time of year); another group debates among themselves whether you are a Borphee grue or an Antharian grue (their accents are similar, especially when pronouncing words ending in "gzk" and "kkgrk.")  Otherwise, your disguise appears to be working, though for how long is anybody's guess.  Convention Hall You are in attendance at the annual Grue Convention, this year a rather somber affair due to the "adventurer famine" that has gripped gruedom in this isolated corner of the empire. Standing at a lectern on stage, a prominent grue is presenting a paper entitled, "Surviving the Lean Years: Is Lurking Enough?"  All around you, grues are standing; some in conversation, some drinking, some even paying attention to the speaker.  There is a trash chute in one of the walls, and a reader board hangs nearby.  You can see some grues, a hat, some clothes, some chewed up shoes and a pair of glasses here.  [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Theater This cavernous auditorium is reputed to be the most elaborate in the GUE. Built to the precise specifications of Lord Dimwit Flathead, its excessive structure holds 69,105 seats, not including the royal box seats that are centrally situated on the 37th mezzanine. The seats themselves are built like thrones, with high, wooden backs that obscure visibility and make the seating area seem rather like a forest of stunted trees. A long aisle runs the entire length of the auditorium from the Cultural Center to the west to the oversized stage to the east. In all other directions, narrow aisles have been arranged in the "maze of twisty passages" style that was so popular in Dimwit's day; I would strongly recommend avoiding them.
e
Stage The rather large proscenium seems to have been designed mainly with live performances in mind (the dead were thought, not unreasonably, to be dreadfully dull.)  As such, it sports a large, maroon curtain leading backstage and a row of brightly colored footlights. Rubble and debris block the ways to the wings, and a set of stairs leads back down into the theater's main aisle.

I'll do the best I can, though. A thick, maroon curtain separates the backstage area from the stage. This area was obviously the target of a small, underground tornado (a Vorx) as scrims, scenery and costumes litter the floor.   Even an old steamer trunk, virtually decaying from age, rests in a corner.

The Mud Forum This large, square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a Multi User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, "Exhibit Closed! Danger!" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind.   Scattered willy nilly around the floor are detailed replicas of a white house, an evergreen tree, a person with a flattened head, a raft, and a hot air balloon.  You can see a tree, a house, a hot air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.
examine tree
The tree is a perfect miniature of the now rare Subterraneous Vegitatus, a species thought to have existed only underground. Its leaves are individually painted, each one a miniature masterpiece. Sitting on the tree is a glass ball and a lone strand of tinsel.
examine ball
It appears to be left over from some ancient decorative holiday. Painted on the inner surface of the ball is a scene of a young man, lying by the curb right by a sewer grate in the street. He's apparently been fishing for coins; he holds in his hands a piece of string, on the end of which is a piece of gum. Stuck to the gum is a shiny coin.

Museum of Illusion The Museum of Illusion was dedicated to the memory of the Great Implementers   figures who were believed to have created the GUE as an act of pure will. Before you, a row of delicately crafted porcelain busts of these immortal greats once stood. Legend has it that so lifelike were these busts, that they would seem to talk among themselves, discussing history, the arts, music, and philosophy, much as those mythic figures did in the Golden Age of Text Adventures. But years of neglect and the ravages of time have toppled most from atop their finely wrought pedestals. Now, alas, the only two that remain are those of Marc Blank and Mike Berlyn, bloodied, but unbent; battered, but unbroken; shaken, but not stirred.  Worse than the physical desecration of this shrine, it is clear that an attempt was made to commercialize what remains, for now, above the busts, is a sign reading, "Consult the Oracles   10 Zorkmids."  Beneath the sign is a coin sized slot.   Mike's eyes, like those on a famous science fiction adventure game box, seem to follow you as you approach. "Marc! Wake up! We have company!"
put coin in slot
The coin drops into the slot, but (unbeknownst to Mike and Marc) remains tied to the tinsel.   Marc looks with some satisfaction at Mike, then assumes a very serious (oracular, one might say) pose. A holographic image of an hourglass miraculously appears beside him, the number "10" glowing inside with a harsh, red light.  The number "10" is replaced by "9" as his voice drops three or four octaves. "Now hear the Oracle of the Implementers," he begins. (7) "The Wisdom of the Ages," he continues, in no apparent hurry. (5) "The Revealed Truth of All Truths," he drones, the word `truths' somehow adding an extra syllable or two. (2) And, finally, "Listen." Then, snapping out of his trance like state, he looks in your direction rather sheepishly. "Sorry about that," he says. "I get a little carried away. Just another five Zorkmids and I'll finish up with a really juicy piece of information."  He looks at you expectantly.  Marc's bust does a double take. "Hmm," he hmms. "Not a bad looking specimen, though back in the old days, they built `em tougher."
pull tinsel
Taken.  Mike's bust looks wistful. "Sigh," he sighs. "Oh for the olden, golden days of yore."
put coin in slot
Mike seems surprised (and not altogether pleased) that you've been able to put the same quint Zorkmid coin in twice. With a blink of his eye, the tinsel goes up in a ball of sparks and flame (pyrotechnics being a specialty with him) and the coin drops fully into the slot.   Marc assumes the oracular position and intones: "Ahem. It may be uncommon knowledge, but, it should be clear to see that text is not a great three D medium. You may be blue, but looking through rose colored glasses helps bring things into alignment."  Mike says, "True, Marc. All too true. As you know, I'd try to pry the sixth rib I saw."

Museum of Adventure This museum is a sick, twisted, and pitiful homage to that special creature as near and dear to my heart as a parser, the Adventurer. There, in the center of the room, sits a display that sends a shiver up your spine: A skeleton. On the small pedestal beside it sits a plaque. The walls have been clawed, the wallpaper and exhibit signs shredded by what was probably an over excited tourist group of grues. In what looks like the remnants of their enthusiastic visit, piles of bones lie on the floor, cracked open, fang marks clearly evident on their glistening white surfaces. One sign on the wall by a door to the southwest remains, though.  The lantern dims a little.

Janitor's Closet As you step through the doorway, you realize you've entered a room so vast, you can see the distant curvature of the Earth. On the distant, foggy horizon, the ceiling appears to meet the floor, blending in the mist. The only thing in this enormous, cavernous area are shelves, shelves and more shelves, all of them empty, dwindling into nothingness. This of course disproves the ancient belief that there's never enough closet space.  On the shelves is an aerosol can.

The Mud Forum  You can see a tree, a house, a hot air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.  The lantern flickers and goes out.  It is now pitch dark in here!
shake lamp
Your rough treatment of the lantern was enough to get it lit again. This must be your lucky day.  The Mud Forum This large, square chamber is certainly messy enough for a mud forum (whatever that might be), but there is no mud in sight (for purposes of argument, it could be postulated that the water source for the mud has dried up, or that mud was brought in for some scientific purpose, or that MUD refers to a Multi User Dungeon of the sort now popular among the better socialized members of the adventurer class.) In the southeast corner of the room a sign reading, "Exhibit Closed! Danger!" overlays another sign, beneath which is a sealed door. On the floor, starting near the center of the room, four large symbols have been painted in royal purple; a large display unit with a heavy wooden cover stands behind.   You can see a tree, a house, a hot air balloon, a flathead and a raft here.

As you push the button, a light shines out from inside the display unit, revealing a transparent film, lit from below. At first, a blurred image appears. Then, after a few moments, an almost magical, three dimensional scene comes into view: a man with a flattened head stands in the foreground, while directly behind him is a tree. Behind the tree you can clearly see a house, while behind the house, hovering off the ground, is a hot air balloon. Oddly, the raft appears off to the side, as if not in the scene at all. After getting a good look, you drop the cover and release the button.  [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

The rat ants appear to be extremely agitated as they spy the huge crystals. One rushes forward, knocking you over in its enthusiasm, and tastes the crystalline boulders originally blocking your exit. The lead ant starts doing what could be called a dance of joy. The others form orderly rows, like chorus lines, and start moving in time to some unheard beat, no doubt led by the leader ant.  With antennae gesticulating wildly, the leader ant quickly and easily lifts one of the boulders as if it were no more than a tiny grain of sugar. The others break their formation and one by one, take a boulder handed off by their leader and head for their homes.  Before you know it, they've made a hole large enough for you to make your escape from the tunnel!

A hinged trapdoor in the floor stands open, and light streams in from below.

Old Winery This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east.  You can see a labelled glass demijohn (which is closed) (in which are a nasty looking red battery and a tourist map) here.  As you disturb the still air, the attic key, which was balanced on top of the demijohn, slips onto the floor and disappears into a crack in the floorboards. Your spirits sink as it does, rattling down some distance. How on earth are you going to get it back?

Aunt Jemima's Lair This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric a brac, and hung up a home made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.  An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about   good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.  Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west.

Disused Observatory Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.

Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball.

Library Storage Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating.

The hollow man mechanically says: "Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real...

Coaches pass by, reminding you of the rapidly approaching time when visitors will have to be let in again for the summer. The only safe way to go is back east into the maze. To one side is a plaque.

Roof This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south.

Battlements The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military looking features were just a seventeenth century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.  It is peculiarly cold here.  An iron, gothic looking key catches your eye.
take gothic key
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.  The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and spluttering.

(first taking the chicken wishbone) (putting the book of Twenties poetry into the canvas rucksack to make room) The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.

You walk confidently into the south wall...  Cups and Glasses This basement room is filled with crate after crate of glasses and cups, enough for an entire hotel, or restaurant perhaps. Almost anything might be hidden among them. A little light comes in from an opaque skylight which is at street level outdoors. There is no way out of here, since the only door is shut tight.  An unlabelled whisky bottle, laid on its side and mounted on a wood plaque, lies deservedly unwanted on one of the crates.
examine cups
In fact there's nothing hidden among the crates but a model sailing ship. You pick it up from force of habit.  There is a scuffling noise as some people gather up on the pavement outside the skylight.
pull anchor
As you pull the anchor chain, the masts fold inwards and the decks concertina back, until you're holding no more than a tight bundle of sticks.  The men begin to talk like conspirators, but half in chants. You catch occasional sounds, but can make little sense of them.
put ship in mounted bottle
The bundle of sticks will just fit through the bottle's neck. With a sudden spring, just as the last of the stick passes the neck, its masts fold out... and you have put the ship into the bottle.  Alarmingly, you catch the odd word "incendiary" and are almost sure you can make out someone say "accursed Meldrew" (in the old fashioned way, you know, so that "accursed" rhymes with "dead"). Paranoia, bound to be. There surely can't really be a conspiracy of druid worshippers out to get you?  [Your score has just gone up by three points.]
examine ship
You look very closely at the fine detail on the model sailing ship. Perhaps it's the distorting glass of the bottle, perhaps your romantic imagination, but the deck seems more detailed, the rigging might almost be swaying, the little figure by one mast might almost be alive...  In fact, the closer you look the more sea sick you feel.  Thank heavens for the deck rail, something to hang on to while this moment of queasiness passes.
fore
Prow of the Lady Magdalena You stand in the triangular prow of the ship, which is graced by a carved and painted figurine and named the "Lady Magdalena". There is no sign of water, but the boat is rocked too often for it to be aground. And the glassy mist hangs ahead.  In the Lady Magdalena's loose grip is a traditional sailor's good luck token: a green leafed branch, to attract the gulls of an approaching shore.

up
Up the Mast Coming up here must be one of your less inspired ideas. The mist is all around you, confusing your senses. Two pale, bluish moons hang in a pink sky.  A flagpole juts out portwards from the top of the mast, far too insubstantial to bear any weight. From it hangs the ensign of the British Merchant Navy (which you could just reach the bottom of).

Stern The square stern of the ship looks out south, not onto receding waves, but to what seems a tunnel through dense, glassy mist. You can faintly make out an odd, pale reddish sand bank in the distance.  The top of the anchor chain is wound around the capstan, a great wheel on the deck beside you. The chain disappears over the side.
turn wheel
You heave away at the capstan, unwinding the great anchor chain.
down
You shin down the anchor chain, down, down, under the keel of the Lady Magdalena, down until there is nothing but the glassy mist and the endless chain...  ...And the approaching soft, spongy, pinkish sand bank, which welcomes you with its warmth: you step ashore, and immediately sink into the clammy, living sand, until you are engulfed altogether... and pass out.  However, the hard attic floorboards beneath your back soon wake you again.

The parts are very old (hand made, not machined) but uncorroded.  The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east.  The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber coloured metal.  Amid the glass wall is an iron panel divided into a three by five grid.  Behind the glass is a kind of see saw of two leather baskets at opposite ends of an oak pivot.

You walk confidently into the south wall...  Causeway A warm winter's night in the ancient city of Alexandria, on the Heptastadion causeway across the harbour to the Island of Pharos (to north). The Mediterranean waters lap against the land bridge, and the whole city (southeast) is lit up with torches: it is a night of celebration.  Austin, your incorrigible ginger cat, lounges around here.  Austin wriggles contentedly.
north
Island of Pharos The island of the Pharos: the lighthouse after which others are named, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, blazes into the sharp moonlit sky. It is 120 metres high, a circle on an octagon on a square.  A light wind blows across the coastal defences. On this spot, seventy two scholars first translated the Old Testament into Greek: shivering continuously if it was as chilly as this. A narrow causeway runs south across the harbour.  In one wall of the wave defences is a rusty seaweed wreathed iron grating, closed up tight.  Interestingly, a key which looks as if it would fit the grating can be seen inside the passage beneath.  Austin strolls regally along with you.  Down below, a wave splashes against the sea front, briefly washing up under the grating.

Crossroads The great crossroads at the heart of chlamys shaped Alexandria, greatest city of the civilised world. The northwest southeast road runs from the causeway to the Tower: the main road runs southwest from the Necropolis gate, northeast to the great public buildings of the city.  A lively, very noisy procession pushes through here, and some spectacular floats are approaching fast.  Austin strolls regally along with you.
southwest
Necropolis A spacious, sombre, moonlit and magnificent valley of tombs, some brand new, just outside the walls of Alexandria (to the northeast). Already it is ancient. Most of the little termite hill style pyramids have been invaded time after time: indeed, one pyramid's entrance gapes open to the south.  Birds of prey circle high in the night sky, their talons glinting in the moonlight.  Austin strolls regally along with you.
blow whistle
(first taking the bird whistle) Fweep!  Fweep!  Austin is startled, but too lazy to look up.  The birds of prey swoop, startled, down to an unexciting tombstone which you hadn't noticed before; but after a moment they relax and slip away into the darkness.  Austin frisks happily.

A lively, very noisy procession pushes through here, and some spectacular floats are approaching fast.  Austin strolls regally along with you.

The Museum guards are so busy abasing themselves before the sacred Cat (incredibly, that's Austin) that you are able to slip inside.  Austin, having at long last found owners even more gullible and undemanding than yourself, ambles away to a life of extreme cossetting and luxury.  The Birdcage of the Muses The celebrated Library of Alexandria, finest in the entire world, possessed of hundreds of thousands of books: where the ruling Ptolemies keep fanatic, infighting scholars almost imprisoned as they turn out rival commentaries on the ancient poems   hence the nickname.  There is a little door to the south; a dusty corridor southeast; a thoroughfare east, and a grand entrance northwest.  There is a pigeonhole mounted on one wall.

Reading Corridor A spacious, densely colonnaded corridor, its walls lined with inset shelves on which are scrolls beyond count, ribboned, dusty, disintegrating, badly catalogued so that only an expert can find what he wants.  The expert in question being Callimachus, who is brooding over a scroll, and hardly aware of your presence.
give kappa to callimachus
Callimachus takes the tube and looks inside to see a scroll, which he pulls out eagerly.  "Arrghhhieee!" he says (untranslatably), boiling over with rage. He then curses repeatedly, but the only word you can make out is "Apollonius". He pushes you out of his way and stomps off.

Librarian's Office A tiny office adjoining the colonnades north, this is home to Apollonius the head Librarian, whose writing implements, table and sand wells are scattered untidily about.

Mosaic This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitors' shoes. It consists of a time worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further.  A hard wooden ball, palm sized, rolls about across the mosaic.

Parish Church Before this was the Norman church of St Michael and All Angels, it was a Saxon one: this is an ancient site. A great space of stone, filled with dark wooden pews and woven mattings. Flowers left over from Sunday grace the lectern and altar. A narrow stair leads upward, and the village green lies to the south.  Old side chapels lie east and west.  Set into the floor, and slightly raised, is the Moonstone, an ancient broad flagstone the size of a door, inscribed with a crescent moon.

The village is tiny: the parish church, the "Goat and Compasses" pub (which, owing to quaint English licensing laws, is closed) and a few houses and desultory tea shops for tourists visiting Meldrew Hall.  Old Evans, the village racing enthusiast, sits on the steps of the memorial, combing the back pages of his "Racing Times" newspaper.

Public Footpath By a stile in the public footpath across the fields to the village, which lies to the north. Sitting on the stile you have a splendid view of the house and its battlements.

Hollow A low, muddy, stinking hollow, trodden with reeds, dried out in the long summer and no more than moist now. You could climb back up, or go northwest, though that would mean crawling through a thorny hedge.  There's a bird's nest at the bottom of the hollow.  Entwined in the nest is a bunch of nuts.

Hanging on Rope You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley.

Valley Prospect The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.  It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation.
east
Roman Villa You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none too secure timber door.
south
Atrium Cloister The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north.  Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear like pole.
south
Atrium The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight.

Guard Quarters Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides.

Hypocaust This very low almost cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth century standards, but you have to admit it works.  A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came.  There is sudden activity as the guards make a thorough precautionary search of the villa. Luckily, they don't even think of looking down in here.

An industrious looking slave (who cooks for the horsemen) is rather surprised to see you, but with creditable presence of mind he summons the guard at once.  Suddenly you are thrust before a druidical figure. He seems to recognise you, and is troubled. Perhaps because of this, your life is saved and you are taken away into custody, down in the valley among the army encampments.  Rough Tent Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole.

A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the relative darkness of the house.  The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.  You can see a daisy chain, some old gardeners' gloves, an electric torch (which is closed), a canvas rucksack (in which are a cloak of many colours, a tube with an alpha on (which is empty), a bird whistle, a strongbox (which is empty), a bladed agricultural implement, the Pan pipes, a miniature, a papyrus fragment, a Tarot box (in which is the Castle), a green branch, a weed killer bottle, a silk handkerchief, a gas mask, a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty), an antique jewellery box (which is empty), a steel wrench, a painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, a nasty looking red battery, a photographer's flash (which is closed), a long wrought iron key, a rusty iron key, a gothic looking iron key, a delicate gold key, a small brass key, three Tarot cards (the Maiden, Star and Ace of Cups), a book of Twenties poetry, an ancient prayer book, a romantic novel and a postcard of the Champs Elysees), a purple sash and the Rod of Infinity here.

I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real...

(to the hollow man) You lose all sense of time and place as the boat drifts down river... It comes as a considerable relief to your befuddled nerves when the man helps you off the boat again, and you find yourself:  Infinity Symbol A cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and glowing with vivid, golden light, so bright it almost hurts your eyes. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the relative darkness of the house.  The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.  You can see a book of Twenties poetry, a daisy chain, some old gardeners' gloves, an electric torch (which is closed), a canvas rucksack (in which are a cloak of many colours, a tube with an alpha on (which is empty), a bird whistle, a strongbox (which is empty), a bladed agricultural implement, the Pan pipes, a miniature, a papyrus fragment, a Tarot box (in which is the Castle), a green branch, a weed killer bottle, a silk handkerchief, a gas mask, a cracked medicine bottle (which is empty), an antique jewellery box (which is empty), a steel wrench, a painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, a nasty looking red battery, a photographer's flash (which is closed), a long wrought iron key, a rusty iron key, a gothic looking iron key, a delicate gold key, a small brass key, three Tarot cards (the Maiden, Star and Ace of Cups), an ancient prayer book, a romantic novel and a postcard of the Champs Elysees), a purple sash and the Rod of Infinity here.  Around the edge of the disc is a circular arc, surrounding the lemniscus, which passes through nine equally spaced sockets or cylindrical wells.  All nine sockets are occupied by rods.

After all, what is your host's purpose in having a party?

If this is the first time you've played a work of interactive fiction, or if you need a slight refresher on the basic commands of a game like this, the tutorial is a good idea. If you've played interactive fiction recently and feel comfortable with the basic commands, then you should probably skip it and blaze ahead on your own.  Remember, you can always type About or Hint at any point in the game if you wish to be reminded about general commands, or want to get game specific hints.  Would you like to continue with the tutorial on?                                                                                                                                   You were helpless. She cornered you at the grocery store between the honeydew and the squash. "Amy dear! How are you?" she asked. And before you knew it she had invited you to a party at her house later that night.  You couldn't say no. Nobody says no to Abbey Fincher, neighborhood watch president and queen of the cocktail party.  It was supposed to be a short visit. Fifteen minutes and out. But here you are, two hours later roped into a never ending conversation with Frank Quinlivan. God knows where your husband, Mark, is. As you stand mere feet from the front door, wine glass in hand, listening to the same story over and over again, all you can think about is getting your coat, your casserole dish, your husband and going home...

If you don't extract yourself from this conversation soon, you're going to scream.
give drink to frank
An idea crosses your mind and before Frank can continue, you offer him your glass. "Here", you say, "It looks like you could use another drink, and I haven't even touched this wine."  Ron's eyes widen in alarm from behind the bar. "I I don't think that's such a good idea," he warns.  "Nonesense!" snaps Frank, ripping the glass from your hand. "Ish jess a night cap, Ron. Fer chrissakes."  "And then I say, who cares? Let's play another round of golf!" Frank finishes and then explodes with laughter.  In one gulp, Frank downs half the contents of your glass. Ron looks at you gravely from behind the bar.
look at frank
Pudgy, balding, and in his mid thirties, Frank wears a sweat stained green shirt and wears a tie looser than his lips. His eyes have become increasingly bleary, and his stories even more rambling as the night wears on. He's had you cornered here for what seems like a stay in Purgatory, but you can't seem to get away, no matter how hard you try.  "Hey," Frank begins again, "I ever tell you the time I went to Disney World and puked on the Dumbo ride? True story!"  Frank tips the rest of the wine down his throat and wipes his mouth with his sleeve.
look at ron
Ron Fincher is technically the host of the party, but his wife, the hostess seems to be more in the party spirit. He is a tall man with an ashen face and an even grayer expression. He wears a thin black suit that fits like it was painted on him, and he stoically mans the makeshift bar with the bearing of someone who would rather be anywhere else. He casually stirs his bloody mary with a stalk of celery. He currently seems to be doing his best to ignore Frank.  "Course," he continues, "I probably shouldna gotten so wasted on Pina Coladas in the Tiki Room, if you know what I'm sayin'." He pats you slyly on the shoulder and you feel a small part of you die on the inside.  Suddenly Frank puts his hands to his stomach. "Oh..." he says. "I done feel so well." He sloppily puts the glass down on the bar and wanders off in the direction of the guest room, mumbling, "I'm gonna lie down fer a biit."  You turn to look at Ron who glares at you pensively. "If he vomits on anything," he says, "I'm holding you responsible."
w
You step into the guest room to find Frank wobbling around the room. Ooh, perhaps you shouldn't have given him that last glass of wine. "Frank," you ask, "Are you doing okay? Do you want me to get you some water?"  "Nah, I'm fine," he says, clearly lying. He slumps over to the bed and begins to crawl on top of the pile of coats.  "Wait, no, Frank," you say, "What are you doing? Get off those coats!"  He looks up at you and smiles a stupid crooked smile. "Shay goodnight, Gracie!" he slurs almost imcomprehensibly and then passes out, belly down on top of your coat and everyone else's.  You frown and bite your lower lip. It looks like getting your coat is going to take a bit of effort. "Goodnight Gracie," you mutter beneath your breath.

Guest Room This small guest room is quaintly furnished, with a large king sized bed taking up most of the space. Sprawled across it lies Frank in a deep slumber. A small closet is tucked into the corner next to the dresser, and a miniature space heater rests at the foot of the bed. On the dresser is an alarm clock. The only exit is back east into the living room.  Your purse lies against the foot of the bed.

Living Room The ceiling lofts high into a round arch in the Fincher's front living room. Paintings tastefully line the southern wall, and a large window looks out into the night. A piano is in one corner of the room and a bar is in the other. Ron stands here behind the bar, on top of which is an array of liquor bottles, a line of glasses and a cocktail book. An archway north leads to the den, a hallway northwest connects to the kitchen, and the guest room, where the coats have been placed, lies to the west. The front door waits invitingly to the south.

You walk into the den where you find your husband along with Chuck Whitman watching the television.  "Come on," you say, "We're going."  "Aw, babe," he says, his eyes imploring you, "It's in the middle of the game! You gotta let us finish."  You purse your lips in annoyance. "How far along is it?" you ask.  "Second Quarter," he says, "But don't worry. It should be over soon. Unless it gets into overtime. Well and the Steelers are playing the Packers right after so... I don't know." He stuffs some more chips into his mouth and looks back to the screen.  You frown. It's obvious your husband isn't leaving without some firm persuasion.

Den Set in soft wood paneling, the Fincher's Den screams comfort and class. A couch sits in front of a cherry wood coffee table with a view to their big screen television. There is a jar of peanut butter, a bowl of chips, a stack of napkins and a remote control on the table. A large glass sliding door, leading out to the porch, stands closed to the north. You could walk back south to the living room, or west to the kitchen.  Your husband, Mark, and Chuck Whitman sit on the couch, avidly watching a football game.  Chuck stands up, excitedly, "He's going for it! He's going for it!" he yells, "And..."
put jar in purse
You need to be holding the jar of peanut butter before you can put it into something else.  Abbey Fincher saunters in from the kitchen. "You know, Amy," she says, "I shouldn't have to tell you how thrilled I am you could make it to our little shindig."

You step into the brightly lit gray kitchen where you find Barb Mason and Sandy Quinlivan gathered around the kitchen island. All you need to do is grab the casserole dish you brought and get out of here. Barb, who sits at a stool in front of your dish, eating one of your rice crispy treats, turns to you.  "Amy, oh my god. I cannot tell you how good these rice crispie treats are. You know, I have been getting the weirdest cravings recently," she says, pointedly rubbing her swollen belly, "And these are to die for. Seriously. I am not letting you leave until I finish these off. They're that good."  "Well," you say, gritting your teeth, "I'm glad you like them."
l
Kitchen The Fincher's kitchen is very modern, with gray marble counters, a beautiful stove, oven, and a rounded island. A sturdy refrigerator stands in the corner of the room next to a dishwasher, each modern appliance deeply contrasted by the old fashioned microwave hanging above the stove. There is a butter knife, a toaster, a bottle of cleaning fluid and a scrub brush on the kitchen counter. The living room is to the south east, and the den is immediately to the east.  Barb Clover sits at the kitchen island, slowly eating from the rice crispies in your casserole dish. Sandy, Frank's wife, sits at her side inconspicuously.

Your husband, Mark, and Chuck Whitman sit on the couch, avidly watching a football game.  "Men." Abbey whispers to you. "They do love their football, don't they?"  "Everything seems to be all right here," Abbey says and with that she ambles to the kitchen.

Thinking a bit of fresh air might help you think, you open the sliding door a crack. From between your legs shoots a small black dog into the house.  You eagerly follow him from the living room into the guest room, where he stands on the bed licking peanut butter from Frank Quinlivan's face.  Abbey follows you close behind and screams. "Oh no! Oh  no!" she cries, "What have we told you about giving kisses to strangers Reggie!" She reaches over and scoops Reggie up and exits the room scolding the poodle, but the work is done. Frank's eyes flutter and he groans as he lifts himself from the bed.  "Where am I?" he asks, his eyes slowly adjusting to consciousness, "What time is it?"  "Time for me," you say, picking up and putting on your coat, "to be leaving."  Congratulations! You now have your coat! You're one step closer to getting the hell out of this party!

Guest Room This small guest room is quaintly furnished, with a large king sized bed taking up most of the space. Frank sits on the edge of it, staring casually out into space. A small closet is tucked into the corner next to the dresser, and a miniature space heater rests at the foot of the bed. On the dresser is an alarm clock. The only exit is back east into the living room.  Frank sips on his glass of water.

You open the guest room closet, revealing a hair dryer.

You plug the hair dryer into the electrical outlet.  "Ooh..." Frank groans, "My head..."
turn on hair dryer
You turn on the hair dryer. It immediately wheezes to life and begins blasting hot air into the room.  The lights quiver and dim.
turn on space heater
You switch on the space heater. Gradually it begins to quietly hum and the front of it turns a pretty amber. You feel warmer already.  The lights grow even dimmer. One more energy draining machine should push the electrical system to the max.
drop hair dryer
You place the hair dryer on the dresser.  "Why won't the room stop spinning," Frank asks to no in particular.

Living Room The ceiling lofts high into a round arch in the Fincher's front living room. Paintings tastefully line the southern wall, and a large window looks out into the night. A piano is in one corner of the room and a bar is in the other. Ron stands here behind the bar, on top of which is an array of liquor bottles, a line of glasses and a cocktail book. An archway north leads to the den, a hallway northwest connects to the kitchen, and the guest room, where the coats have been placed, lies to the west. The front door waits invitingly to the south.   Abbey Fincher walks around the room, inspecting the furniture.  "My goodness!" Abbey says, cornering you by the piano, "You spent so much of your time talking to Frank that we never got a chance to chat. How are things?"  "Fine," you say, "Just fine."  "Oh dear," says Abbey, "A host's work is never done!" and with that she dances to the kitchen.
nw
Kitchen The Fincher's kitchen is very modern, with gray marble counters, a beautiful stove, oven, and a rounded island. A sturdy refrigerator stands in the corner of the room next to a dishwasher, each modern appliance deeply contrasted by the old fashioned microwave hanging above the stove. There is a toaster, a bottle of cleaning fluid and a scrub brush on the kitchen counter. The living room is to the south east, and the den is immediately to the east.  Abbey Fincher stands against the wall, smiling with an unnerving fervor.  Barb Clover sits at the kitchen island, slowly eating from the rice crispies in your casserole dish. Sandy, Frank's wife, sits at her side inconspicuously.  "You are positively glowing!" exclaims Abbey to Barb.  "It's probably the sheen on my skin," says Barb, "I can't help it. I sweat like a pig."  "Amy dear," Abbey says, plucking the jar of peanut butter from your hands, "I appreciate you helping out, but the spreads belong on the coffee table with the rest of the snacks!"  Abbey leave the kitchen for the den, carrying the jar of peanut butter with her.
plug toaster into wall
You plug the toaster into the outlet.  "Do you know if it's going to be a boy or a girl?" asks Sandy.  "Nah," Barb says, "I'd rather be surprised. Course, with my luck it'll be a freakin' hermaphrodite."
turn on toaster
You press down on the toaster lever and the inside coals begin to glow bright orange.  Suddenly, the entire house goes dark. It looks like you've pushed the electrical system over the edge.  "Way to go, Amy," you hear Barb snark in the darkness, "I told you not to mess with that microwave!"  "Don't panic! Don't panic everybody!" you can hear Abbey frantically shout through the house, "Ronald, darling! I think we may have blown a fuse."  "Yes, dear," you hear Ron call from somewhere else, "I came to the same conclusion."  It is now pitch dark in here!
e
Darkness It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.  "Well, don't you think you might want to do something about this electrical problem?" you hear Abbey yell.  "I'm working on it now, dear," you hear Ron shout from somewhere distant in the rest of the house.
z
Time passes.  "Please, everyone!" shouts Abbey from a different room now, "This is only a temporary denouement to the the festivities! The lights will return to us shortly!"
z
Time passes.  "It's so nice to see the television get some use," Abbey confides to you, "Ron hardly uses it at all. He's always holed up in his study, reading! Reading! In this day and age? Can you imagine!"  "Oh dear," Abbey says, looking at you worriedly, "It's best not to run around with these things," she says taking the knife from your hand. "We don't want you tripping on something and falling on it, now do we? Think of the liability!"  Abbey walks into the kitchen, carrying the knife.  Suddenly the lights return and the sounds of electrical devices whirring back on flood the house, along with relieved sighs from everyone in the room. Don enters the room and examines the television.  "Thank God!" says Chuck, lunging for the remote and turning the teleivision back on. Only, the screen floods with blue and an error message displays. "What the hell's wrong with this thing?" he asks outraged.  "Yes," says Ron. "I was afraid this would happen. A power outtage disrupts the signal. We'll have to call the cable company to get the cable reset."  "Well how long is that going to take?" asks Chuck.  "Oh goodness!" Don replies dourly, "Several hours, probably. If it's anything like last time." And with that he exits back into the living room.  Chuck and your husband give a collective groan, and then Mark turns to you and says glumly, "Well, I'm ready to go whenever you are.  Congratulations! Your husband is prepared to leave the party! That's one step closer to getting the hell out of this party!
l
Den Set in soft wood paneling, the Fincher's Den screams comfort and class. A couch sits in front of a cherry wood coffee table with a view to their big screen television. There is a jar of peanut butter, a bowl of chips and a stack of napkins on the table. A large glass sliding door, leading out to the porch, stands closed to the north. You could walk back south to the living room, or west to the kitchen.  Your husband, Mark, and Chuck Whitman sit on the couch, looking around restlessly.

You pick up a small napkin from the top of the stack.  "Amy," your husband whines, "I wanna go now!"  "I don't want to hear it, mister," you scold.

An archway north leads to the den, a hallway northwest connects to the kitchen, and the guest room, where the coats have been placed, lies to the west. The front door waits invitingly to the south.   Ron takes a sip from his bloody mary.
order drink
"I'd like a drink" you say.  "How about a singapore sunrise?" he asks you.  You think about it for a moment. "Sure," you say a little nervously.  "Right away," Ron tells you putting his glass on the bar, "This is my favorite drink to mix. It's a complicated process, you know."  Ron turns around and grabs a bottle from behind him.
take celery
You pluck the celery stalk from the bloody mary. It drips with tomato juice.  Ron, his back to you, pours that bottle, plus several others into a shaker.  Abbey Fincher saunters in from the kitchen. "I do hope you're enjoying the party!" she says.
wipe celery with napkin
Gingerly you wipe off the celery with the paper napkin, and throw the napkin into the trash. There! Good as new!  Sort of.  Well, look at it this way: At least it's not dripping with Tomato juice.  Ron shakes the concoction together.
put celery in purse
You put the cleaned off stalk of celery into your purse. Now nobody can see it! It's your little secret.  Ron pours the contents out into a glass.  "Darling, honey," Abbey asks her husband, "How are things at the bar?"  "Fine, dear," he says without emotion.  "Here we are," Ron says, turning around and placing your drink on the bar, "One singapore sunrise." He picks up his glass gingerly and is about to take a sip from it when he notices the celery missing.  "Where is it?" he asks you.  You raise your hands, as if equally dumbfounded. "Search me!" you say.  Ron frowns at you. "I'll pass," he says coldly.

"So of course Chuck expects Dad to pay for everything," Barb tells Sandy, "But I'm like, we're not living in the freaking middle ages! Cough up some dough. We'll go dutch!"

You take the butter knife.
put peanut butter on celery
You dip the knife into the jar and spread a nice long line of peanut butter along the line of the celery stalk.
put raisins on celery
You carefully place a line of raisins down the line of the celery stalk. They stick to the swath of peanut butter and hold fast. Congratulations! You've officially made Ants on a Log!  "Look at me!" Barb tells Sandy, "It's like I swallowed a goddamn watermelon! The baby's due next month and we're not getting married 'til May. If I'm still this size by spring then shoot me. Just shoot me."

You show Barb the Ants on a Log you made. "Oh. My. God." she says, clearly astonished, "You are, like, the best friend ever!" She takes it from you and takes a slow bite from the end, clearly in heaven.  "Oh, it wasn't any trouble," you lie.  "Here" she says, pushing the casserole dish towards you, "Take them. Who needs rice crispie treats when you can get the real thing! Oh! This is yummy!"

"You can't leave yet!" she says with a manic glint to her eye, "We haven't played any party games!"  You stand at an impass. Abbey blocking you from the door.

Release 3 / Serial number 960606 / Inform v1502 Library 5/12 Standard interpreter 1.0  Monastery Chapel You are standing in a monastery chapel. All around you, fellow Brothers of the Order are standing, chanting. The eerie droning voices seem to reverberate into the air. At the front of the chapel, Brother Joseph stands in deep concentration, holding the Rod of the Ancients.
z
Time passes.  Brother Joseph now speaks directly to the entire Order.  "Fellow Brothers, the year, as you know, is 976 GUE. A difficult time indeed. Ten years have passed since the Cataclysm brought forth by the Circle of Enchanters changed our world forever. The outside world as we know it is in turmoil. A period of great change is upon all of us."
z
Time passes.  Brother Joseph continues speaking.  "Our order has always maintained the strictest secrecy. Few outside of our order know of our existence. We are the keepers of the mystic balance that which embodies pure magic that can keep our world safe. It has always been thus    we watch over all of Quendor, never interfering in the affairs of others, yet striving to maintain harmony."
z
Time passes.  Brother Joseph continues speaking.  "But we can no longer depend on enchantments to keep outsiders at bay. Magic as we know it is dying. The dreaded Age of Science is already upon us, and in short time, our order will be discovered, and the balance will be no more. Many of our order have gone out into the world in secret, in attempts to repair what has been broken, but alas, this appears to be impossible."
z
Time passes.  Brother Joseph continues.  "I have brought you all forth today to say that although we cannot protect the future of Quendor, we can protect ourselves!" He holds the Rod of the Ancients high. "This holy Rod, which the Ancient Ones used to defeat the demon Anabais, has the power to protect our order. I have discovered a lost mystic cube!" He holds a white, featureless cube high in his other hand. "This cube, when joined with the Rod of the Ancients, will preserve our order forever, sequestering all of us in another time, another place!"
z
Time passes.  There is a momentous pause.   Brother Joseph looks at the entire Order. "May the Gods smile down upon us on this day! We go now, into the unknown!" He triumphantly joins the white cube to the end of the Rod of the Ancients.  There is a sudden, blinding white flash! The chanting is instantly broken by a tremendous thunderclap! Brother Joseph is suddenly thrown back by a great force, and to your horror, the Rod of the Ancients breaks apart! Four pieces now float serenely above the altar, above a strange black globe that seems to crackle with energy.  "AT LAST!"  The voice comes from nowhere and everywhere. The black sphere pulsates with lightning.  "ANABAIS IS FREE AGAIN!" The voice pauses. "I see you found my fake mystic cube Joseph. I knew that someday, someone would find it, and free me from my prison!" The voice pauses again. "To show my gratitude, I'm scattering this broken symbol to the corners of the world!" The pieces of the rod suddenly disappear!  "Watch out!" someone cries. The black sphere suddenly expands with alarming speed. Seconds later, a violent explosion seems to jar the very ground you stand on, and a black void covers all.  You awaken in your room in a cold sweat. Was it all a terrible dream? The day beckons...  Your Quarters You are in your room in the Monastery. It is sparsely furnished, but certainly feels like home. The exit is north.  You can see a note and a sleeping pallet here.

Main Hall This is the main hall of worship in the Monastery. A large domed ceiling hides some sort of lighting that create a warm yet serene atmosphere. A covered walk to the rest of the Monastery lies to the south. To the north is the Monastery chapel. A brazier sits in the center of the room.
n
Monastery Chapel You are in the Monastery Chapel, the site of the recent appearance of the legendary Anabais. Signs of the recent visit include the slightly scorched walls, and the reek of brimstone. Wood pews are arranged in a circle around the central altar. The exit is south. Brother Joseph is here, standing by the altar.  Joseph smiles as you enter. "I'm glad you found me. As you know, thanks to the old fool standing before you, the demon Anabais is loose upon the world once more. He has broken the Rod of the Ancients which was keeping our house and Order protected from outsiders. It is a sorry day for us all." Joseph pauses for a moment. "You are our final hope in a time of chaos. Brothers Palemon, TuffBerry and Toolbox have left the Order, and only you remain. I must now ask you to serve the Order which you have so faithfully served in the past. No short order this, for our continued existence depends on it, but you must go out into a world gone mad alone, and retrieve the four broken pieces of the Rod of the Ancients, and return them here to me, so that we can rid the world of the evil we have loosed!"  Brother Joseph pauses and searches his robes.  "Here, you will need this," he says, giving you a strange amulet. "Without this amulet, the Ancient Ones cannot give you the mystic aid that you will most certainly need. But I waste much time. Go now, and may the Gods smile upon us all."

You are surprised by a cold blast of wind as you leave the Monastery!  Cliff Face You are standing near the top of a snowy mountain peak. The wind is quite cold and is making your teeth chatter. The general vicinity is mostly snow and rock; however, the entrance into the Monastery is to the north, all but hidden from view by the enormous slabs of snow covered rock that make up the cliff face. There is a rough but obvious trail leading down the mountain to the south. There is also another trail that winds even further up the mountain peak almost hidden in the snow to the east.

u
Mountain Peak You are standing on the top of a peak of the Gray Mountains. A cold wind blows snow everywhere, obscuring what would otherwise surely be a wonderful view of the surrounding countryside. You can just make out some buildings to the far south in Frostham. A snowy bluff marks the way back down, or to the west, there appears to be a snowy outcropping. It seems to hang precariously over the edge of the mountain, however.
w
You carefully make your way onto the outcropping.  Snowy Outcropping You are standing on a snow covered outcropping. You are almost waist deep in snow, and the blisteringly cold winds aren't helping. The outcropping juts out alarmingly over the western edge of the mountain. In fact, you can see the Monastery steeple below this ledge. The main portion of the mountain peak lies to the east.  There is a dirty scroll here, practically buried in the snow!  Some snow falls off the outermost edge of the outcropping.

You give the best bellow you can muster, given the current weather conditions. Unfortunately, you seem to have disturbed something, as the entire outcropping gives way in a brief but powerful avalanche! You tumble through the air, followed by a large quantity of snow! But suddenly, you see the Monastery steeple rushing up to meet you!  THUMP!  You lie dazed for a moment. Miraculously, the dirty scroll lands next to you!  Steeple Roof You are on a very narrow ledge outside the Monastery steeple. The snow and wind are doing their best to send you to a ungracious death below. The steeple roof is quite sharply slanted.

Delbin's Pub Delbin's Pub has been a popular food and drink spot in South Anthar for quite a while. Usually, you need to fight off barbarians to find a place to sit. At the moment, however, the place is unusually quiet. A group of barbarians seem paralyzed with fear near the back wall, glancing nervously at the front of the bar. The exit is to the north.  A gaudy headdress of some kind is hanging on a nearby wall.  On the bar are a glass of ale and a dirty rag.  There's a warrior maiden sitting at the bar, her eyes riveted to the glass of ale.  There's an old wizard sitting at the bar, his eyes riveted to the glass of ale.  There's a gentleman dressed in black sitting at the bar, his eyes riveted to the glass of ale.  Delbin himself is standing behind the bar.

Well, with the shutdown of the Brewers Guild in Borphee since the Great Change, I can't keep that particular beverage in stock, but I've got that one left there. Seems none of them's leaving until they decide who gets the ale    and let me tell you, those three are folks who don't like to be disappointed!"

"This crazy looking old fellow stops in the other day. Said that he was a professor, at GUE Tech, but that he was giving that all up! Something about his research going bad, on something he called 'an ethereal gate'. What all of that means, I can't say."  The man in black makes a lightning fast move for the glass of ale, but is countered by an equally fast move by the warrior. "Lose something, thief?" the woman says.

It's a biography on the life and times of Duncanthrax the Bellicose. Most of it chronicles fairly dry stuff about his much publicized conquests of the Eastlands and his famous battles. There is an interesting  bit about some secret trophy chamber that Duncanthrax had constructed near the end of his reign, but for more details, I'd suggest "look up (word) in book" specifically.

There appear to be notable entries on "trophy", "Zilbo", "Griffspotter", "Diablo", "Ogre", and "Silvermane".

Apparently, in 680 GUE, Duncanthrax grew increasingly withdrawn. At this time, of foremost importance to him was his collection of various battle trophys and awards he had bestowed to himself (for unusual valor on the field of battle) over the years. He decided to construct a hidden underground chamber south of Egreth to sequester this collection, which would be locked in a most clever means. He decided to order the construction of a "four room key" which, when a miniature trophy was inserted and removed (once) in a special keyhole in each of the four rooms (in a specific order), would unlock a holding chamber in a center room containing his prized trophies. Priding himself on his logic skills, he requested that two captured foreigners produce a logic puzzle plainly inscribed in the four key rooms themselves that would detail the exact order that the key rooms were to be "applied". A Prevaricon, who could not help but write untruths, was given a can of gold paint, while a Veritassi, who could only write the truth, was given a can of silver paint. Imagine Duncanthrax's rage when he discovered that the two prisoners had secretly painted over their gold and silver key phrases with _black_ paint! The prisoners were summarily executed, of course, but Duncanthrax sealed off the chamber and researchers can only guess at the final fate of the trophy collection of Duncanthrax.

(the textbook) "A colorful myth among ancient races has been called 'The myth of the Four Brothers' by Elder Kroonwatz (the famous Royal Chronicler). The story states that at the dawn of time, four evil gods, who were brothers, sought dominance over that which would become our world. Great battles were fought between forces of light and darkness, and these brothers were often victorious. Fortunately for us, they could not cooperate with each other, and fought amongst themselves in petty power struggles, driven individually by power and greed.  Indeed, legends state that on occassions, the brothers would seek ways to actually destroy their own siblings, along with the forces of good. One brother constructed a strange artifact that would have given him great power, but was discovered by agents of good. He was imprisoned within the very object he built. The remaining three, facing certain defeat without the combined strength of their trapped brother, fled into planes unknown, but made a pact that if the brother were ever freed, and the artifact of power returned to him, the four would agree to make their final attack against the forces of good. Kroonwatz points out the obvious parallels with various other mythologies that foretell the end of the known world."

"On the Structural Strength of Woods", a short, fairly dry research paper. Apparently, the researcher was testing the breaking point of various woods. The conclusions reached are summed up in the final paragraph:  "In summary, our findings indicate that out of the materials tested, Ebony wood is clearly the best choice, and Balsa wood clearly the worst. Balsa wood structures broke immediately when even the slightest weight was tested on them. Pine wood structures fared slightly better, holding light weights, but tended to break on repeated stress. Ebony wood structures were approximately twice as strong as Pine structures, holding up to at least one repeated stress test before breaking."

The general area is filled with boarded up houses, and a few shifty eyed characters are the only people milling about here. A road leads north. To the east is an abandoned flat, probably in better shape than the rest.

The zombie seems to regard the gloves, and slowly puts them on. It proceeds to open the metal box and remove a loose wire, producing a few sparks in the process. Finally, it places the loose wire on the floor, satisfied. It slowly crumbles into dust, but you just manage to hear, "Thanks, I've been trying to get rid of that wire for ages," in the faintest of whispers.

Southern Fublio Valley You are in a southern region of Fublio Valley, where someone apparently decided to start a city. So far, a couple huts and farmhouses are the result. A rather run down farmhouse lies to the southwest, a trail runs through grasslands to the south and a smaller trail runs along the hills to the southeast. To the north, you see a decrepit old building. There is also a stairway into the ground here.  Standing on a tall pole next to the stairs is a circular sign.

Nearby, someone has dug some shallow holes in the sand, probably farming for live Rotund Oysters, a popular Eastland delicacy.Unfortunately, the oyster beds are too far inland, and they appear to be empty. A bit to the west you can see a small shoreline cave in the rocks.

Dark Damp Cave You seem to be in some underground cave. There are no visible exits. You feel rather claustrophobic. You also hear some unexpected noises.

read memo
BANK WORKER GUIDELINES  If at any point, account activity has been suspended (i.e. all regular account vaults have no funds) then it must be ensured that 20 zorkmids remain in basis, for potential loan requests.  Otherwise, vaults must be maintained as follows:  For interest waiting to be paid, the amount must equal the amount held in the loan payments vault. If this amount goes over the loan payments, talk to your local gnome manager to see about getting some outstanding loans paid back.  Overhead should be kept at the amount in interest, plus five.  Loan payments should be kept at a positive amount.  Make sure that both the loan and interest vaults are maintained properly, and at the same time, the overhead vault is maintained while the basis vault is kept at a non suspended bank amount. If this is not the case, you may need to put some overtime in to straighten out the bank funds.

Forest Edge Dark forest meets dark city outskirts here. The only exit is along an old path to the southwest    the forest is too thick for travel otherwise. Rain falls periodically from a dark stormy sky.  You can see an angry treant and a log cabin here.  A rumble of thunder booms overhead.  The treant angrily attacks the wood cabin, which shakes with the continued blows.
x treant
Treants are basically animated trees. They are considered mythical creatures, usually solitary and quite rare. This particular treant looks similar to a great elm tree. You notice that it seems covered with spots of some sort of blight.  The treant hammers on the house and you hear a crack! The cabin sustains some damage!

Your prayer book begins to shake! Slowly, ornately, the words of the shazok chant are inscribed, into the book with a violet glow. The book's brightness fades, but the chant remains! However, the scroll on which it was written vanishes as the last word is copied.  A rumble of thunder booms overhead.  The treant angrily attacks the wood cabin, which shakes with the continued blows.

Howling in pain, the creature runs off into the woods and disappears!  Moments later, a woodsman appears from the battered log cabin. "Much thanks, sir," he says. "Appears I mistook that treant for a dead tree and tried to cut it down. Can't say he took it too well." he says sheepishly. "Say, you don't look like you're from around these parts. Kinda like this funny thing I found in the woods the other day." He hands you a strange round object. "Maybe you know what to do with it?" He hefts a small hatchet over his shoulder. "Well, back to do a little logging," he says, as he walks off into the deep forest, whistling.  [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

The sign reads:  "WELCOME TO ARAGAIN!  As today (and everyday henceforth) has been decreed his royal lordship's birthday, we request that all visitors respect good king Sydney Flathead's wishes and present a cake appropriate for the occasion before entering."  Well, that's odd. If memory and Brother TuffBerry's Quendor History lessons serve, the Flathead family died off more than a hundred years ago.

You begin the long trek upwards. Strangely, the stair seems to twist and move as you step on it, turning like a corkscrew, until you are graciously deposited at the top, far above your previous location.  Fancy Hall This must be an apartment or penthouse in the skyscraper. You are in a very high hall, with black slate stone walls that seem to reflect shadows everywhere. There is a room to the north. The southern edge of this room drops off into the darkness, followed by a long spiral staircase. The ceiling overhead seems to have tiny points of light like a night sky.

This appears to be a short collection of notes:  "TIPS ON CRACKING THE NEW FROBOZZCO 3 DIAL COMBO LOCKS:  Remember, there's a slight flaw in the design. For every correct number in the correct dial, pressing the opening button with cause a small click. Dials with the correct number in the wrong dial place will cause a small thunk. The lock mechanism scans for correct numbers in correct places first, and then for correct numbers in the wrong place in the 'remaining dials'. Simple! But don't forget, closing the locks will automatically lock and reset the dials!  NEW FLATHEAD PAINTING:  I've completed making the copy of the new Leonardo Flathead painting, received courtesy of the Royal Museum. Glad to say my skills in art forgery are undiminished    I can barely tell the difference between the two myself! I'll soon replace the original with the copy, and no one will be the wiser!"

You can also see a group of soldiers, a wicker cage (which is closed) (in which are a speckled windcat and a spotted windcat), two red flags and two blue flags here.  The Ranger sees you approach and recognizes you. "Well met again, Priest. I have need of your assistance to end the kobold border war that has been going on far too long." She pauses. "To the west and east are two of my lieutenants and their soldiers, cut off from the rest of us by previous kobold raids. I have the power to end this war and call a truce, but to do so, I need to inform both of my lieutenants to stop fighting via windcat message carriers." She points to the two windcats in the wicker cage and the pile of colored flags. "The 'red' flags indicate 'attack', the 'blue', truce. When my lieutenants receive the instructions, they will verify my commands by sending additional messengers with 'attack' or 'truce' instructions to each other. Based on the two received messages, each lieutenant will act accordingly." She slaps you on the back, jolting you to attention. "Herein lies my problem, Priest. I know for a fact, that one of my lieutenants is a traitor, who will disobey my orders. Any instruction I send to the traitor, the opposite will be sent by the traitor to my remaining good lieutenant. The traitor will also take the two orders he receives and do the opposite, if there is a majority, or attack outright, if there are messages of 'truce' and 'attack'. Thankfully, my good lieutenant will faithfully copy my instructions to the other lieutenant, and will follow orders received, if there is a majority, or follow a 'truce' if there are mixed messages. My greatest problem, Priest, is that I do not know which lieutenant is the traitor! If you can bring peace once and for all to Southern Egreth, many will remember your good deeds."

The army soldiers yell a round of "Three cheers!" before heading off. Morgan shakes your hand with almost enough force to break it. "Well done indeed, Priest.

It's a strange metal box. On top, perhaps connected in some way, is another metal box with a glass plate on the front. Strange wires seem to be attached to the boxes somehow. In front of the boxes is an odd plastic flat object with rows and rows of plastic buttons labeled every letter in the alphabet.  Looking closer, you notice curious glowing letters on the glass plate. You read the letters, and feel drawn to respond...  SPIRITWRAK DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM: (AUTOMATIC OBJECT GARBAGE COLLECTION) REMOVE OBJECT IMPENETRABLE_STEEL_WALL?

Some Implementor. Looks more like a oddly dressed young man badly in need of a haircut. He's also sound asleep!
wake implementor
You manage to rouse the Implementor from his slumber. He stares at you, bewildered. "What are you doing here?" he asks. "I'm afraid you'll have to go back." The Implementor snaps his fingers, and suddenly, you're back in...  Ethereal Plane of Atrii Flat, featureless gray is in every direction you look. Directly overhead, you notice odd streaks of light. From here, you could wander this gray dimension in any direction, it seems.  You can see a flower vase (which is empty) here.

Cave Intersection You are in a large open cavern. The rough limestone here was probably eroded by underground springs to form the somewhat circular chamber you now stand in. Oddly, there seems to have been a recent cave in, as piles of rubble line the walls. A tunnel snakes off to the west. To the southeast, there is a wide square hole!

As you enter the tunnel, a strange light surrounds you! The four rod pieces you were carrying crumble into dust!  Mystical Cave You've entered a wondrous natural cave, lit everywhere by reflected light from some sort of purple crystalline substance in the walls. A tunnel exits to the northwest.  There's a purple crystal sphere partially embedded in the rock floor here.  Lying in one corner of the room is a skeleton.  You can also see a blackened parchment, a silver rod piece, a red rod piece, a green rod piece and a brown rod piece here.
read blackened
"I write these final words not in the hope that others will find and heed them, for this is too great a hope in my moment of death, but rather, to try and maintain my mind and soul in the face of the terror I now know is the truth.  For how can a man survive, knowing that his entire life, his entire belief, has been a ruse, a dupe, from the early beginning? That he has merely been a pawn in a working of evil that cannot be stopped?  I have fought all manner of terrors, and recovered that which I know is the _true_ Rod of the Ancients, broken and scattered eons ago in the face of great evil. I sought also those ancient spheres that the Four Ancients never had the chance to use against the evil four elemental demons, but alas, I could not find them all, and sequestered those which I did with good people that the elemental evil could not touch.  Alas, my quest has ended here. I lie trapped here, with the pieces of the true Rod in hand, unable to go forward, trapped by the elemental mystic locks on the rod that prevent it from leaving this very room, yet unable to go back, to leave the rod here and deny the very real danger of the defeat of the Ancients, of the power that the evil elementals hold.  What is a faith destroyed? Who can help me to believe, in my moment of disbelief?    P  "

Snowy Intersection You are at a snow filled crossroads in a mountain trail. Paths lead north towards the top of the mountain, east, west, and south towards the base of the mountain.

Part of the marker breaks off, and the dragon flies off, whimpering in pain!

On strange boat You are on a long open boat, riding the waves of some great sea. The boat seems to be filled with sailors from some militia.  You can see a sea captain here.  You suddenly realize that you are being held fast by two navy sailors! The captain walks forward and points his cutlass near your ear.  "What we have here, lads, is a stowaway!" Some sailor cries out "Overboard with the stowaway!" The captain smiles. "Now, we was planning on feeding you to the groupers, but we could use a scullion in the hold. One things for sure, ye ain't finding passage on this ship if ye ain't aligned with the Antharian Navy cause!" Some sailor cries out (unnecessarily) "The Antharian Navy cause!". "So, tell us lad, are ye with us? If ye are true, you'll tell me the Antharian Navy patron saint! So speak quickly, lad, if ye wish to stay dry!"

The boat starts to tip and sway, and the two sailors release you and hastily try to help raise the rigging!

You drop the green rod and watch it roll near a mast and get stuck in the floorboards.  There's a load crack! The ship is breaking apart! Sailors scramble in vain for safety! You hang onto the side of the boat, but the vessel rocks wildly, and you fall into the waters.   As you sink, you notice the waters seem to change to a purplish hue, and you find yourself back in...

It fits, but seems just slightly tilted.  "That's perfect," you hear a voice say, and the crowd murmurs in agreement. Why, it's Babe Flathead himself! He saunters up towards the statue, which is indeed a good likeness, and starts handing out cigars. "We'll get to autographs later," he says while lighting your cigar as you try to protest. Seconds later, the cigar explodes! You see sparkling stars, which seem to change to purple flashes. You blink.

He looks at the patch somewhat unsatisfied, but shrugs, and walks off, soon out of sight.
break wall

The street disappears into the fog to the north and south. The door to the house is to the west.  You have come in response to an urgent summons from your old landlady, Mrs Hudson. As the fog swirls around you, you huddle into your coat and shiver in the predawn chill. Saturday  5:00:00 a.m.
KNOCK ON DOOR
> You hear a bolt sliding back and the door opens to reveal a worried Mrs Hudson.  "Oh Doctor Watson, I'm so glad to see you. It's Mr Holmes, sir. Three days have come and gone since he's been out of his rooms. He won't eat and I know he hasn't slept. Now there's a visitor who says he's here about some important government business.

The entry hall is just as you remember it   small, underheated, and lit by a feeble gas light. The door to the parlour is to the north, and a flight of well worn stairs leads up to the first floor.                                        Entry HallSaturday  5:01:00 a.m.

> Holmes's Study  You step back through time to your bachelor days, when you shared these cluttered digs with the world's only consulting detective. Despite the mess, you can see that the room is unchanged. The fireplace to the north has a pile of letters transfixed to its mantelpiece by a jackknife. Next to them lies Holmes's six shot revolver, the tobacco slipper, and Holmes's favorite pipe. The violin has been carelessly tossed onto a stack of obviously unread newspapers.  Holmes is slouched on the sofa, lost in a black mood of despair. He is pale and emaciated, and his sharp eyes burn with fever. He is staring at a phial that he holds in one hand. His free hand rests near a hypodermic syringe in a neat morocco case at his side. You realize that he is fighting a depression brought on by what he calls "the dull routine of existence."  The bedroom door to the west is closed. The only other exit is the door to the south.                                        Holmes's StudySaturday  5:03:00 a.m.

Holmes jumps up and ushers the gentleman to the armchair, dismissing Mrs Hudson at the same time. "Watson," he says, "I am sure you recognize our distinguished visitor. I presume, sir, that you have come about the Jewels."  The visitor half rises from his chair in protest and sputters, "But...but, how...?"  Holmes calms him with a glance. "Come, sir. What else could it be? The Tower is suddenly closed, and within hours I receive a call from the highest official of Her Majesty's government. A simple deduction. Now then, tell me about the theft."  The visitor settles back into his chair and says, "We know very little. Only that the Crown Jewels were stolen from the Tower sometime Thursday night. The theft was discovered Friday morning, and we immediately closed and searched the Tower. All we found was this verse which was left behind in the empty jewel case."  The visitor removes a folded piece of paper from his pocket and gives it to Holmes, who glances at it and passes it on to you.  Do you want to continue waiting? Please press Y or N >

For two score years I reigned alone,      A virgin queen on England's throne.      My navy caused Armada's shame,      And with me died the Tudor name.                                 The apple sorely tempted Eve,      And Tell another aimed to cleave.      But when one fell, it showed to me,      The mighty pull of gravity.                                 My father, it was said, would die,      Beneath the Holy City's sky.      Jerusalem his body claimed,      And it is after him I'm named.

If the Regalia is not at Buckingham Palace in time for the Coronation Day festivities, then all is lost."

Obviously the person who stole the Crown Jewels wanted the authorities to turn to me for help, and it is equally obvious that the thief has laid down a trail for me to follow, in hopes of somehow entrapping me.  "So let's play his game, Doctor. But let's play it by our rules. The thief will have tried to anticipate the sequence of my actions, and I'm sure he has laid his trap accordingly. But if you were to guide the course of our investigations, he will certainly be thrown off the scent.  "Therefore, let us take surprise onto our side and rely on your instincts as the man of action I know you to be   despite your frequent modest assertions to the contrary." He steps to one side and says, "Lead on, good Doctor. I will follow." Holmes gestures for you to lead the way.                                        221 B Baker StreetSaturday  5:21:00 a.m.

Just then, a distinguished looking gentleman appears on the scene, takes her by the arm, and says, "Come, Eliza. We mustn't be late for the ball."

There is an old librarian here, on whose desk sits a handwritten sign that reads "Quiet, please." There are thousands of books behind glass cases, but one is lying unattended on a table. The only exit is to the west.  The librarian   who is as dusty as the books   looks up in surprise as you come in. He says loudly, "Oh, I say! Hello! I don't get many visitors here. Is there something I can help you with? Some information about the Jubilee, perhaps? It's quite rare, you know, for a British ruler to celebrate 50 years on the throne. Unique, in fact. The closest anyone else came was Elizabeth, who ruled 45 years   although our records are somewhat vague before the year 900. The Anglo Saxon chronicles do get rather sketchy, what? Still, they're the best we have. I think I can find a copy for you somewhere here."  The librarian's voice trails off as he bustles from shelf to shelf, squinting at the books to find the one he thinks you want.  Holmes drifts in after you, apparently lost in thought.

"The vases of the fourth dynasty of the ancient Sumerians differed significantly from those of the third dynasty. The most pronounced change involved a slight flaring of the handles from one dynasty to the next. Most experts agree that this symbolized a drastic change in the Sumerians' perception of the goddess Ashtoreth. Others however, believe it made the vases easier to carry." Saturday  9:22:00 a.m.
SHUT UP
> The librarian stops in midsentence and gets an embarrassed look on his face. "Oh, I say. I'm sorry to have rambled on like this, but I do so enjoy speaking with visitors. I get them so seldom, you know. Thank you for listening."  He leaves the room, mumbling something to himself about the articulation of the third joint of the hind leg of an extinct species of dung beetle. Saturday  9:23:00 a.m.

I believe that in order to solve this mystery, you are going to have to go to the Tower of London. It will be closed, but you can give the password 'Aragon' to the guard at the Byward Tower. He will let you in. Good luck."  Mycroft pauses before he goes and looks at you meditatively, as if trying to decide if he can put his faith in you to rescue his brother.

To the west is the entrance to one of the least savory buildings you have ever seen. There is a faded sign above the door that informs you that the establishment was, in better days, known as the Bar of Gold.  Fortunately, it is only a short walk back up the stairs to Lower Thames Street.  The urchin joins you and starts looking around with interest.

swordfish
> The denkeeper disappears into a back room and reappears moments later, accompanied by a tall, silent man who has dark skin and wears a white turban.  The Indian glances at your head and then intones, "I am Akbar, honourable sir. What is it that you wish?" Monday    2:01:00 a.m.
GIVE GARNET TO AKBAR
> Akbar takes the garnet and examines it closely. Then he says, "I must ask you to come with me, sir. But first, I ask that you give me all that you carry." He takes everything you give him, and then apologizes as he places a blindfold over your eyes. He leads you down a series of long winding corridors. You hear a door close behind you, and when he finally removes the blindfold, you are standing in Moriarty's lair. Akbar locks the door behind you, drops the key on Moriarty's desk, and piles most of what you were carrying onto the floor.  [Your score just went up by 5 points. The total is now 89 out of 100.]  Lair  At last you come face to face with the evil Professor. He is sitting placidly behind his desk, looking at you as if you were some botanical specimen.  As you look around the room, you see Sherlock Holmes tied to a chair. He is only inches away from the Crown Jewels, which Moriarty has spread out on his desk, the better to taunt Holmes.  Holmes looks up and says, "Ah, there you are Watson." He turns his head towards Moriarty and says, "You see, Professor, you grossly underestimate the intelligence and determination of your fellow countrymen."  "Watson," he continues. "The Professor and I have just been chatting about why he led us on this merry chase. If you care to ask him, I'm sure he would be happy to fill you in as well."                                        Lair   89Monday    2:02:00 a.m.

GET AMPOULE
> Moriarty's normally emotionless features dissolve in rage. He shouts at Akbar, "Why didn't you take that from him when you brought him in?"  The outburst startles Akbar into momentary inaction, but he quickly recovers and starts to come towards you with a violent look in his eyes. Monday    2:04:00 a.m.
HOLD BREATH

> Moriarty: You tie up Moriarty. Akbar: You tie up Akbar. Monday    2:08:00 a.m. Your lungs scream for air. You take a deep breath.  The etherium knocks you out.  You awaken slowly and stumble to your feet. Moriarty and Akbar have already recovered, and they are struggling fiercely to free themselves.

GIVE JEWELS TO GUARD
Familiar as your dream may be, the shapes and the colours that surround you feel as scary as ever. For more than two months the beginning of your nightly nightmares have stayed the same. The old woman drags you up from your bed. Your struggles are in vain against the iron hard grip of the bony hands as she pushes you out of the window. But instead of falling headlong towards the backyard below you find yourself in an alien world, trying desperately to wake up.  The Temple An Interactive Homage to H.P. Lovecraft (c) 2002 Johan Berntsson  Please type "help" for instructions and license information. Release 2 / Serial number 021118 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/2 Standard interpreter 1.0  Void You plunge through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and distorted sound, whose material and gravitational properties are beyond reason and understanding. The abysses are by no means vacant, being crowded with hazy objects, much like shadows, that are moving around in a haphazard manner.
x me
You try to feel your body, but get only the strangest feeling. Something is there, but no reaction, no nerve pulse, feels normal. As you look down on your body you see only a haze, like those of the shadows around you.  A cascade of red colour explodes below you.
x shadow
They are sometimes stationary, sometimes moving around. Their movement is not linear and they seem to suddenly dissolve from one place, only to appear from nothing in a new place, apparently at random. Although they sometimes are close to you they always appear hazy.  Suddenly there is a new element in your dream, one you have never experienced before. A sense of blinding fear threatens to overwhelm you as a shape appears close to you. There is nothing visually different about it, but you can't bear looking at it for very long.
x shape
In your current state of fear your mind and body refuse to cooperate.  The shadow disappears somewhere. A slave under someone else's will, you find yourself moving towards a place you have never seen before.  Roof The city below you is ancient. Dark domes and steep roofs form a silent silhouette against the clear star filled sky. You are standing on the roof of a tower, built of crumbling masonry, which seems to be centuries old. An iron railing of strange design circles the perimeter of the roof and a winding staircase leads down.
pull railing
The railing won't budge, but one of the statues breaks of in your hands.
x statue
In the stone the artist has carved a hideous monster. It is vaguely human shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place.
d
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.  Study Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.  On the desk is a yellow paper.
x paper
On the paper is a coded message and it is impossible to say even in which language the text is written.
take paper
Taken.
x table
The base of the stone table is covered with carvings, each showing different kinds of creatures, or maybe Gods, standing on stone tables. Humans, who seem to be reciting prayers or spells, are standing in front of the creatures.  You spot something behind the table. Pushing the cobwebs aside, you reveal some writing, crudely painted on the stone wall with black paint.
x writing
It seems to be a poem, or chant. The language is unfamiliar and complicated, and you repeat the syllables with a low voice: Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee l'geb f'ai throdog.  Even as you speak you sense something approaching. The light in the room darkens, and a mysterious green glow is emitted from some dust on the stone table. Its brightness intensifies to an unbearable level and you involuntarily step away. A shape appears on the previously empty table. As the flash fades away you recognise the shape as that of a man, lying still on the table.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]
x man
The unconscious man is young, tall, and white. You guess he could be of British descent. The most striking thing about him is his clothes, which looks at least eighty years out of fashion.
touch man
After several attempts, you manage to shake the man awake. He sits up on the table, still confused. In response to your many questions the man simply states that he can't remember and it seems that he is suffering from amnesia.
x books
You browse through the library but can't find any books written in a language you can read, so you leave them alone.  The man gets up from the table and looks around, perplexed. 'I think I've been here before', he mutters.
x dust
The dust is everywhere.  The man asks who you are. You tell him about your dream, and how you ended up here.
x desk
The desk is well used and the surface has many scratches and stains of ink.  The man falls silent for a while, and then he says: 'Some parts of my memory have come back now. I remember that my name is Charles Bristow and I studied archeology and history in New England. Something terrible happened but of that I can recall only small fragments.' He looks around the chamber and says with despair in his voice, 'My God, where am I? Will my nightmares never end?'
d
Hall This damp hall occupies the whole ground level of the tower. A staircase provides access to the higher levels, while a massive oak door, set in the southern wall, leads out.  Charles comes walking behind you.
x door
The door is big and made of crude oak logs, which have darkened to almost black with time and wear. The lock and the iron handle look handcrafted and antique.  Charles tries to open the door and says 'It's locked. Do you know where the key is?'
u
The winding staircase leads to a spacious chamber inside the tower.  Study  Charles comes with you.
s
Storage This is a minor storage chamber, connected to the study through a doorway in the northern wall. There are some shelves, mostly vacant, here.  On one of the shelves are four small vials, each neatly labelled and containing some green powder.  Charles follows you.
take vial
Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.  Charles picks up a vial. 'I saw this before in a dream', he says and puts it back.

Randomly you pick one of the vials from the shelf.

You explain your idea for Charles and he lifts you up. After a few moments of nervous search your fingers touch cold metal. You jerk it out and Charles puts you down again. The fruit of your effort is an iron key.  [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

You open the oak door.
s
Before A Dark Tower This area in front of an old tower offers a nightmarish view over a monstrous tangle of dark stone buildings. Most buildings are elliptical, built of irregular sized basalt blocks of irregular size. None of them seem to have any doors or windows. There is a square further down to the southwest. The sole passage to the tower is through the door to the north.  Charles comes walking behind you.
x tower
Judging from the masonry the tower must be centuries old. It towers high above the nightmarish city below.  Charles looks nervously around.
sw
Public Square There is a large public square here, surrounded by the same strange elliptical buildings on all sides except to the east, where a high wall built of massive sandstone blocks stands. There is a road to the west leading deeper into the city. Against the sky you see a high tower to the northeast. The only trace of life comes from the south where a road leads to what appears to be a temple.  Charles comes with you.
x sandstone
The wall is running in north south direction. It is constructed of huge sandstone blocks and must be more than twelve feet high.
x temple
The temple is an impressive and forbidding structure, adorned by mysterious mural paintings. Many people have gathered inside, and muffled sounds of praying can be heard even from the outside.  Charles is lost in thoughts.
ask charles about temple
'Look at the carvings, and the strange shape of that building! I know well what that temple is housing. It is a house of worship of the evil Gods. Don't go there if you value your life.'

Road Wandering through the deserted city you stumble upon something unexpected. A large crack yawns darkly into the side of one of the ponderous elliptical buildings to the north. You wonder what monumental forces could have effected this rupture. The road extends to the east and west.  Charles comes walking behind you.
x crack
The crack is just wide enough to squeeze through.  Charles sighs deeply and says  'Will I ever see Miriam again?' to himself.
n
Squeezing through the crack, you manage to enter the building.  A Dark Hallway The building is of great size and decorated with extreme elaborateness, giving you a glimpse the nameless past. The walls are covered with mural carvings, whose interpretation escapes you. The smoothness of the sheer stone walls is interrupted by a crack that gapes into the southern wall. A doorway to the north leads deeper inside the building.  Charles comes walking behind you.
x carvings
The carvings shows picturesque patterns and figures, but you have a feeling that they are not meant for decoration. Instead, they make you think of illustrations in works of physics and mathematics.  Charles studies the wall and says 'Nice carvings, but I don't understand what they mean.'
n
Library This is an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groining rise indefinitely into the murky shadows overhead. The exposed stonework features mural carvings in curvilinear designs. Vast shelves of dark wood line the walls, but they are all empty. Although deserted, the place has the air and the feel of a big library. The main exit is to the south.  Charles comes with you.
x carvings
A shout of surprise stops you in your tracks. Charles is standing in a remote corner, looking down at something. You move closer, and find a skeleton lying partly hidden in a niche.
x skeleton
The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing. Its bony hand is clutching a note.  Charles points at the skeleton and says 'Poor fellow, I hope we don't end up like him'
take note
Taken.  Charles is lost in thoughts.
x note
A message is written in spidery script on the note:  I must be brief, because there is not much time left. The fever is burning in my body and I think I won't survive the night.  The Caelestae Horriblis has answered many of my questions. I know of the evil Gods of the past. I now understand that the barbaric rites in the temple have raised them from their eternal sleep and that it is only a question of time before they reconquer Earth. When this happens, we are all doomed. Our only hope is to reimpose the ban once set upon the evil Gods by the Eternal Ones. A sacrifice, on which a mystic symbol is written with holy powder, is necessary to summon them . Hidden in the cryptic language of the Caelestae Horriblis were the ingredients for this powder, and I gathered them in my hideout. I have searched for the exact shape of the mystic symbol, but this knowledge has been denied me. My time is running out, but I know that people from Earth are sometimes thrown into this dimension, and my last wish is that someone can continue where I failed and prepare the sacrifice.
show note to charles
Charles looks at the note and suddenly grows pale. 'Mother of God...', he whispers and drops the note on the floor, 'it is my handwriting.'
x skeleton
The yellowed remains lie face down on the floor, still covered by torn clothing.  Charles is lost in thoughts.
x torn clothes
The skeleton is dressed in the torn remains of a tweed jacket and cotton trousers.

x book
A forbidden book of ancient lore, unfortunately written in Latin, which you can't read. One thing of interest is that the title, Caelestae Horriblis, and the author's name, Abtin Mukhtar, have been written both in Arabic and Latin letters.
x vial
When you compare the writing on the label with the name written in the Caelestae Horriblis, you discover a vial labelled Mukhtar!  [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

Apart from it being labelled Mukhtar, it looks identical to the other vials and contains some green power.  Charles is lost in thoughts.

Dead End This part of the town is radically different from the parts closer to the tower. The roads are narrower and the paving is irregular, sometimes stone slabs and sometimes cobblestones. The buildings are tall but less well kept than before. There are still no windows or doors, but there are a few overhead bridges from house to house. The road ends here and the only way out is to the north.  A cat is sitting on one of the overhead bridges.  Charles comes walking behind you.
x cat
The cat is almost completely white. Only a spot on its tail is black. It is sitting on an overhead bridge and looks frightened.  Charles says 'Oh God, I'm so tired of this. I only want to return home.'  The cat says 'Meow.'
x slabs
The paving consists of stone slabs and cobblestones. It is in bad repair.  'I used to have a cat, you know' Charles remarks.  The cat says 'Meow.'
search slabs
One of the stone slabs seems out of place. Kicking it emits a hollow sound, much like there was some cavity below it.  The cat looks down at you.
move slab
You push the stone slab aside, revealing a entrance to a staircase, leading down into darkness.  The cat looks scared.
d
Stairs You are the top of an staircase, leading down into darkness. A few steps above is the opening, through which you can return to the city.  Charles arrives, and looks around with a puzzled expression. He seems to hesitate briefly, and then says 'Look, I know that this must sound insane, but ever since I came here I keep getting the feeling that I have seen this place before, like in a dream or in a distant past that I have almost forgotten.'
d
Charles looks down the stairs and says gravely 'Don't ask me how, but I just know that if I go down there I won't return alive. Go ahead if you have to, but I will stay here and wait for you.'  In the almost complete darkness, the stairs seem endless but you finally arrive to a corridor far below the city.  Corridor The staircase to the south opens into a wide corridor, reaching further north. One both side massive walls rise, culminating in massive vaults, on which carvings are just visible. The floor is strewn with fallen blocks, sand, and detritus of every kind.  Behind and above, a faint luminous blur tells of the distant world outside.
x carvings
The stone is badly fragmented and the carvings almost gone.
x blocks
They are just shapeless fragments of stone.
n
Corridor This is a Cyclopean north south corridor ten feet wide, paved with octagonal and square blocks, and solidly vaulted overhead. A side passage once led west, but it has collapsed.
n
Chamber You are in a round vaulted chamber, about fifty feet across. The black masonry suggests that this might be a room under one of the mysterious buildings in the city. The chamber is bare and undecorated. Two corridors lead from this room, one to the south and one to the east. Looking up also reveals a square opening in the ceiling.  In the floor just below the opening in the ceiling is a trapdoor. It is closed and carefully sealed down with metal bands.  Seeing the trapdoor suddenly gives you an unexpected feeling of fear, and suggestions of some special peril.
x trapdoor
The trapdoor is carefully sealed with metal bands, which look strong. Its size corresponds to the opening in the ceiling above, and it is possible that it might lead to similar chamber below.
e
Corridor This is a badly heaped east west corridor. It is almost completely dark, but you can make out a chamber further east. In the north wall is the entrance to a caved in corridor.
e
You struggle through the debris.  Rock Chamber This is a black chamber, directly cut in the rock. Crystals embedded in the walls reflect and magnify the available  light. There is an antique gas stove mounted in one of the walls, and a rack just above it. The sole exit leads west into a dark corridor.  The chamber seems ancient, but the furniture feels more recent. Someone must have been using this chamber not so long ago.  You can also see a chair and a wooden chest (which is closed) here.
x stove
It is an old gas stove, which can be turned on by turning a switch. On the stove is a kettle.  The gas stove is currently switched off.
x kettle
The kettle is empty.
x rack
The rack is mounted on the wall above the stove. On the rack are some red powder, some yellow powder and a glass bottle, inside which is a clear liquid.

s
Road An endless array of indistinguishably drab stone buildings lies at either side of the road. Though humbled by the sheer magnitude of the other buildings, a distinctive temple like structure catches your eye at the south end of the road. Flickering light emanates from its high and narrow windows, casting uncertain shadows on the murals that adorn its wide doorway.  Charles follows you.
x mural
The murals decorating the main entrance to the temple are hard to interpret. Some humans are engaged in what appears to be a ritual. One is bringing a tray with something on it to a table and the others are standing a few paces behind, holding long knifes.  Charles looks at the temple and says 'I think that the tower and the temple are more recent than the city itself. The style is quite different, don't you think?'
listen
From inside the temple sounds of chants and prayers are heard, but the are too muffled to make out clearly.
s
Temple The temple is an immense building, whose vaulted ceiling towers high above. It is scantily lit, but a stage is set in its southern part. On the stage there is a huge statue, whose appearance is frightening even from this distance. In front of the statue is a roughly cube shaped black stone table. There are lots of people in front of the stage, and the air is filled with sounds of chants and prayer. The main exit is to the north.  Charles follows you.  There is some commotion as a man is led up to the stage by a few persons, who force him onto the stone table and ties him down.
x huge statue
The huge statue on the stage is indeed grotesque and frightening. It is vaguely human shaped, but the arms are too long, the skin is covered by scales, and the fangs are definitely out of place.  A hooded, priestly figure carrying a dagger approaches the victim on the table. Without further ceremony he stabs the man in the chest. People around you start chanting terrible hymns in a foreign language.  You notice suspicious glances from people close to you. Charles whispers that it is better to leave before the crowd get too suspicious, and leaves the temple.

Once again you read the syllables of the chant aloud... Y'ai'ng'ngah h'ee l'geb f'ai throdog.  The green sand emits a faint glow which quickly assumes an unbearable brightness. When the light finally dissipates, the vial is gone. Nothing seems to have changed, yet you detect something alien in your mode of thinking.  The sight of the writing evokes strangely uncommon thoughts.  A stream of incomprehensible thoughts floods your brain, as if an alien presence was occupying your mind.  You are unsure whether to attribute it to fatigue or to insanity.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]
x paper
A deep feeling of frustration in projected into your brain. This soon gives away to a concentrated study of the papers. One sentence is revealed, then another. Before long, Mukhtar has decoded the message, and you are swept away in a powerful vision.  Dark Chamber This is a small chamber with rough walls, cut directly from rock. There is a fireplace set in the wall, and a doorway leading west.  You can see an old man here.  The man seems to be at work. He puts a handful of yellow powder in a bowl.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]
x old man
You see nothing special about the old man.  The man puts some red powder in the bowl. He then put the bowl on the fire.
z
Time passes.  The contents in the bowl turn black. The man uses the black powder to paint a complex symbol, much like a epsilon character, onto his chest.  The scene abruptly changes...  Temple You are in a huge building, whose vaulted ceiling towers high above. It is scantily lit, but a stage is set in its southern part. On the stage there is a huge statue, whose appearance is frightening even from this distance. In front of the statue is a roughly cube shaped black stone table. There are lots of people in front of the stage, and the air is filled with sounds of chants and prayer.
z
Time passes.  There is some commotion as a man is led up to the stage by a few persons, who force him onto the stone table and ties him down. The man is the same old man you saw in the dark rock chamber a few moments ago!
z
Time passes.  A hooded, priestly figure carrying a dagger approaches the victim on the table. People around you start chanting terrible hymns in a foreign language with increased fervour at every passing instant. The priest lifts a sacrificial dagger over the man's body   the congregation's hideous howling rises to a crescendo of inhuman ferocity   and then the dagger dives hungrily into the flesh.  The huge statue explodes in a brilliant flash of light and violent tremors begin shaking the ground. Blinded by panic, the cultists begin a hopeless race to the exit   running, shrieking, cursing and shouting   but their fate has been sealed. Deep cracks root through the marble ceiling, which plummets on the writhing mob with a resounding crash.  The next moment the vision is gone...  Study Dust and spider webs cover all surfaces in this room in a soft silver gleam, blurring the outlines of the furnishings into fantastic, dreamy forms. The walls are lined with bookshelves and a lone desk lies at one corner. Close to a staircase, which leads further up and down the tower, is a massive table made of black stone. A doorway leads to a smaller room to the south.  Although nothing can be seen, you feel the presence of Mukhtar's mind here.  You can also see Charles Bristow here.

The rumbling slowly dies out, and from the underground chamber you hear a nasty, slopping sound like as of something soft being dragged along a hard surface. The sound becomes more and more distant, as the monster disappears in the abyss whence it came.  [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

You struggle through the debris.  Chamber The round chamber is badly damaged, and the south wall has partly collapsed, spreading debris over the floor. The metal seals have been forcibly thrown open and the trapdoor yawns open. A strong stench emerges from within the dark opening.  The eastern corridor, and the ceiling with its square opening, has escaped the worst of the destruction, but the entrance to the southern corridor is blocked by rocks and boulders.
yell
You scream from the top of you lungs, and receive a faint reply. It is Charles, who has overcome his fear to search for you. He starts digging from his side, and after much hard work you have cleared a passage. However, even your combined effort isn't enough to move one heavy stone, which is protruding into the tunnel, and making it too narrow to crawl through.

Charles notices the symbol painted on your chest and exclaims: 'That must be the symbol of the Eternal Ones! I've never seen it, but I have read about it.'

Public Square  A cat, probably the same you saw on the overhead bridge before, emerges from the shadows.  The cat suddenly perks his ears and looks towards the wall. For a moment he only stands listening. Then his tail starts waving and he runs towards the wall.  Alerted by the cat, you hear a faint sound, as if someone was scratching on the other side of the wall.  Charles comes walking behind you.
listen to wall
(the sandstone wall) It sounds like someone is scratching on the other side of the wall.  Charles says 'When do you think those who built this city moved out? Five hundred years ago, or more?'  The cat is creeping along a certain section of the wall.
x wall
(the sandstone wall) The wall is running in north south direction and is more than twelve feet tall. The cat is obviously interested in a part of it, but there is nothing that makes this section stand out. But wait... isn't there a faint outline of a door, almost perfectly cut into the wall?  The cat is clawing at the wall.
x door
The door is cut out of sandstone, and crafted with great care to be almost impossible to make out from the rest of the wall, unless you know where to look.  The cat is trying to insert a paw between the sandstone blocks of the wall.
open door
You push the secret door open, revealing a dark passage leading east through the sandstone wall.  The cat darts forward into the passage and disappears in the shadows.
e
Entering the shadowy passage, you find yourself in a short corridor ending at drapery. Pushing it aside gives you entrance to a cavernous hall.  Deserted Hall You find yourself in a immense hall, faintly illuminated by rays of light falling from an opening in the distant ceiling. The far corners are all shadows, and the purpose of the hall is hard to guess. A strange device is standing in the middle of the room.  Charles comes with you.
x device
The device consists of a high metal column, crowned by a cluster of glass bulbs. It is obviously manufactured with great care, and the lever on its side suggests that it is a machine of some sort.
x column
It is simply a tube of metal, about six feet wide and twenty feet tall. There surface is absolutely smooth, only slightly soiled by oxidation.
x bulbs
The glass bulbs are fitted in an intricate pattern at the top of the metal column, way out of reach.
x lever
The huge lever is mounted at the base of the column.
pull lever
A sputtering is heard from the machine, growing to a whine, terminating in a drone. At the same time, the bulbs go on, increasing their luminosity until they assume a pale blue colour.
z
Time passes.  Charles is lost in thoughts.  Suddenly, from the farthermost shadows, a sound softly drifts towards you.
z
Time passes.  Close to the machine, a cloud of white vapours appears, quickly growing denser and taking a round shape, floating just above the floor. It keeps getting bigger.
z
Time passes.  The round cloud is hanging just above the floor and getting denser and bigger by the second.
z
Time passes.  Charles looks nervously around.  As the cloud gets bigger and denser, it starts glowing from within. Then, in the centre of the cloud, confused pictures appear before your eyes. Flashes of star filled skies, unrecognisable shapes both alive and otherwise, and blurred images of temple like halls, soon give way to a view of a beautiful young lady standing on a busy market street.  'Miriam!' Charles exclaims, 'that girl is Miriam, my fiance. And this is the main street in my home town.' He runs towards and into the glowing cloud.  In the cloud you now see Charles running up to the girl. He takes her hand, to the dismay of the passersby, and talks excitedly with her.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]
enter cloud
The scene with Charles and his fiance abruptly dissolves before you have a chance to enter the cloud, and another picture can be seen. It is night, and the only light comes from the stars and two braziers, which you can see from some distance. People are gathered around the braziers.  Maybe the machine is affecting your senses, because the picture appears brighter and closer. You now see that there is a black monolith between the flaming braziers, and that the silent crowd of people appearing as barbarians, some clad only in hides of wild beasts, all have their eyes fixed on the top of the stone.  Your attention is caught by some commotion at the base of the stone. A young boy, stark naked and bound hand and foot, is pushed upwards by two men. There something grabs the boy's head and starts pulling him. Quickly shifting your gaze, you stare at disbelief at the creature now squatted on the top of the monolith, which only moments ago was empty.  It is a huge monstrous lizard like thing, with four green, blinking eyes. The apparition's wide gap is opened, ready to devour the poor boy, when it suddenly becomes tense. It lifts its head, and the four eyes stare at you.

The light bulbs immediately go out, and the drone of the machine slowly dies out. The cloud quickly dissolves into thin vapours of smoke.

You are roughly pushed up on the stage, where assistants push you down on the stone table and tie you down.  Stage From the stage you can see the northern part of the temple and the many spectators who observe all that takes place here. Dominating the stage is a huge statue, made of black stone. In front of the statue is a table. There is a smell of death in the air and the table, the statue, and the floor are covered in fresh blood.
z
Time passes.  A hooded figure, wielding a long, blood encrusted dagger emerges from the shadows. He walks up towards you, raising the dagger over his head.

The faces of the council members look grim. Gilgern continues to speak.  "Of course, something must be done soon," he says in that gruff, hearty voice you have come to dislike so much. "Must restore public confidence and encourage the return of people to the land. Can't just leave the place to the likes of dragons and trolls. We must all make money again. Isn't as though it's just arrived, dragon's been there for years. Just that people found out about it, that's all."  Marzipam looks round nervously at the others in the so called Council of the Wise.  "Of course, we can't afford to pay you much. We are just poor men ourselves. Think of this more as a civic duty..." he wheezes.  Around you the other travellers and adventurers shift nervously.  Gilgern hurriedly adjusts his glasses and glances down at the scroll in front of him. "Says here that the Great Worm can be beaten," he goes on. "Sword of Erondil is the only weapon which can penetrate a dragon's scaly hide. Enchanted weapon, you see. Last seen many years ago in the Castle of Abercorn. Big, ugly place. Near the sea, I think, if memory serves me right. Dragon must be getting a bit careless and lazy by now. Been there all that time. Stands to reason. Might get in a lucky hit or something."  Marzipam breaks in. "Or there's the spell, I suppose. The dragon is supposed to be held in place under an old enchantment, though that's perhaps just an old tale. Break the spell and the dragon will leave, the story goes..."  "Well, which of you is interested?" Gilgern looks across at you and the other adventurers. You begin to wish you had never set foot in the town   it just happened to be on your journey, that's all. You've no wish to tangle with dangerous dragons or anything else.  As Gilgern looks down, you suddenly find that the other adventurers have all quietly taken a couple of steps back, leaving you out in the front.  "Splendid", chortles Gilgern before you can say anything, "We've one brave soul willing to risk their all for our little cause. Welcome, stranger..."  Before you know it, you have been whisked away from the town square in a donkey and cart and deposited beside a track.  "Good luck   you'll need it!" calls the driver over his shoulder, as he hurries away.   Welcome to Dragon Adventure. You start your quest on a mountain path in the North East...  (Type INFO at any time for more playing information.)  Dragon Adventure A simple text adventure for players aged 9 and over, by William Stott Release 2 / Serial number 040211 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10   Rocky Mountains It is a clear, bright morning and all seems peaceful. A tiny sparrowhawk wheels and soars lazily in the cool empty air above. There is a steep pathway to the south leading down into dense woodland, and you can make out an old building by the path. In the distance you can just glimpse the steel grey of the sea, far away to the west.   You can go north, south, east or west.
s
Abandoned Inn An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west.   You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).

Inn Cellar The cellar seems to have been formed from a natural cavern in the rock under the inn, which has been smoothed and extended to form a storage area for the sorts of things inns need to keep   casks and bottles and the like, which will remain cool in the slightly chill air. There are the remains of some old barrels, but almost everything else seems to have been removed from here long ago. Dim daylight filters down the open stairwell from the inn above, where there is a flight of steep stone steps. By the far west wall stand thick stalagmites which rise out of the floor like dragon's teeth, behind which is a dark opening. It might be your imagination, but you think you can just catch an occasional dry, rustling sound coming from deep inside the darkness. The uneven floor is covered in dust, and at first glance you see no signs of life apart from your own boot prints.   You can go up (to the inn) or west (into the dark tunnel).  You can see an ancient silver coin and some barrels here.

Abandoned Inn An old, thatched building stands near the path. It seems to be an abandoned inn or tavern, as a faded sign reads 'Troll's Arms'. The walls are a dirty white and the paintwork is starting to peel and blister. The windows are covered in cobwebs and there is the faint odour of mildew and decay. Weeds grow between the flagstones of the path leading up to the door, which leans open. No one seems to have lived here for years. A path leads north into the mountains and there seems to be some swampy ground to the west.   You can go north (to the mountains), west (towards a swamp) or east (into the inn).

Swampy Ground Water seeps around the soles of your boots and fills your recent footprints. You can hear the croaking of frogs and the occasional bubble of marsh gas coming to the surface.

Damp Tunnel The cave floor is moist from condensation, and your flickering candle casts pools of pallid light which sway and dance through the shadows.

There are many stalactites and stalagmites, some of which have joined to form delicate pillars, others just hang like creamy icicles in the still, crisp air. Frozen rivers of snow white rock spill down from the ceiling beside a dark fissure that spits the southern wall. Occasionally you see fireflies dancing and darting between the columns of pale stone.

Distorted formations of twisted rock rise from the cave floor, while gossamer traceries of stone seems to float in the air to create delicate screens and alcoves. Everywhere hang pale stalactites. The floor of the chamber is covered in red dust and pieces of broken white bone.   The great creature itself is lying coiled in the corner, its slate coloured flanks slowly heaving and falling as it breathes. Its immense wings are tightly folded on its back and look as if they have been carved from polished copper. One of the beast's horny claws is resting on a pile of ivory coloured bones. The air is sickly sweet and dank.  Tunnels lead north and west.  You can see a huge dragon and a pile of bones here.

The magical sound of your playing has woken the Dragon from its deep enchantment...   All is quite silent, but a honeyed voice of ancient darkness creeps deep into your head.   "Who are you who disturbs my sleep?" the creature asks slowly.  "I was imprisoned here by wicked charms in this cave where the water seeps, in the cold, dark heart of the mountain.  I must guard gold, where caverns hold the lost treasure of ancient kings and other beings long since vanished from this world.  I have been here so long I have forgotten why.

You make your way down to the front porch.  Front Porch This is the enclosed front porch of your home. Your front garden lies to the south, and you can re enter your home to the north. On the doormat is a pile of junk mail.
Get Mail
You gather up the pile of mail.
South
Front of House You can enter your home to the north. A path leads around it to the northeast and northwest, and a country lane is visible to the south. All that lies between your home and the huge yellow bulldozer bearing down on it is a few yards of mud.  Mr. Prosser, from the local council, is standing on the other side of the bulldozer. He seems to be wearing a digital watch. He looks startled to see you emerge, and yells at you to get out of the way. The bulldozer rumbles slowly toward your home.
Lie Down In Front Of Bulldozer
You lie down in the path of the advancing bulldozer. Prosser yells at you to for crissake move!!!
Wait
Time passes...  The bulldozer thunders toward you. The ground is shaking beneath you as you lie in the mud.
Wait
Time passes...  The noise of the giant bulldozer is now so violently loud that you can't even hear Prosser yelling to warn you that you will be killed if you don't get the hell out of the way. You just see him gesticulating wildly.
Wait
Time passes...  With a terrible grinding of gears the bulldozer comes to an abrupt halt just in front of you. It shakes, shudders, and emits noxious substances all over your rose bed. Prosser is incoherent with rage.  Moments later, your friend Ford Prefect arrives. He hardly seems to notice your predicament, but keeps glancing nervously at the sky. He says "Hello, Arthur," takes a towel from his battered leather satchel, and offers it to you.
Wait
Time passes...  Ford glances uncomfortably at the sky. He offers you the towel again.
Wait
Time passes...  Ford seems oblivious to your trouble, so you ask "Ford, what about my home?" He looks startled, then guilty. He starts to say something and stops. He starts to say something else and stops. Suddenly he seems to see the bulldozer for the first time, stops starting to say things and starts.  He seems to come to a momentous decision, says he has something of Earth shattering importance to tell you, and stresses the importance of a quick drink at the Horse 'n Groom.  Pointing toward Prosser, you exclaim "But that man wants to knock my house down!" Ford goes off for a quiet word with Prosser. From where you're lying, you cannot hear what's happening, although they seem deeply engrossed in conversation.
Wait
Time passes...  Ford and Prosser stop talking and approach you. Ford says that Prosser has agreed to lie in your place so that the two of you can go off to the Pub. Reluctantly, Prosser steps forward and lies down in front of the bulldozer. You stand up.
Wait
Time passes... Ford, urging you to follow, hurries toward the country lane.
Follow Ford
In a state of anxiety and confusion you follow Ford down the lane...  Country Lane The road runs from your home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west. Ford Prefect is here.  "Come along, Arthur," says Ford impatiently, and enters the Pub.
Enter Pub
Pub The Pub is pleasant and cheerful and full of pleasant and cheerful people who don't know they've got about twelve minutes to live and are therefore having a spot of lunch. Some music is playing on an old jukebox. The exit is east. Ford Prefect is here. There is a barman serving at the bar. Behind the bar is a shelf. It is full of the sort of items you find on shelves behind bars in pubs.  Ford buys lots of beer and offers half to you. "Muscle relaxant..." he says, impenetrably.
Look Shelf
Use prepositions to indicate precisely what you want to do: LOOK AT the object, LOOK INSIDE it, LOOK UNDER it, etc.  "Drink the beer," urges Ford. "It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam."
Buy Sandwich
The barman gives you a cheese sandwich. The bread is like the stuff that stereos come packed in, the cheese would be great for rubbing out spelling mistakes, and margarine and pickle have performed an unedifying chemical reaction to produce something that shouldn't be, but is, turquoise. Since it is clearly unfit for human consumption you are grateful to be charged only a pound for it.  "Drink the beer," urges Ford. "It will help cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam."
Drink Beer
It's very good beer, brewed by a small local company. You particularly like its flavour, which is why you woke up feeling so wretched this morning. You were at somebody's birthday party here in the Pub last night.  You begin to relax and enjoy yourself, so when Ford mentions that he's from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, not from Guildford as he usually claims, you take it in your stride, and say "Oh yes, which part?"
Drink Beer
It is really very pleasant stuff, with a very good dry, nutty flavour, some light froth on top, and a deep colour. It is at exactly room temperature. You reflect that the world cannot be all bad when there are such pleasures in it.  Ford mentions that the world is going to end in about twelve minutes.
Drink Beer
There is a distant crash which Ford explains is nothing to worry about, probably just your house being knocked down.
Exit
Country Lane You see the huge bulldozer heaving itself among the cloud of brick dust which is all that remains of your home. As you start up the lane, a small dog runs up to you, yapping.  Ford hurries after you.
Feed dog sandwich
The dog is deeply moved. With powerful sweeps of its tail it indicates that it regards this cheese sandwich as one of the great cheese sandwiches. Nine out of ten pet owners could happen by at this point expressing any preference they pleased, but this dog would spurn both them and all their tins. This is a dog which has met its main sandwich. It eats with passion, and ignores a passing microscopic space fleet.

Throughout the noise, Ford is shouting at you. He removes a small black device from his satchel, but accidentally drops it at your feet.

(We were lying about the exit to port.) You emerge from a small doorway...  Entry Bay Number Two This is an entry bay for the Heart of Gold. A corridor lies aft of here. There is a sales brochure here.  "This looks like that incredible new Infinite Improbability Drive spaceship, the Heart of Gold!" says Ford, with growing excitement.  "Announcement, announcement. This is Eddie (the shipboard computer). We have just picked up two hitchhikers at an improbability factor of 2 to the 21,914th power to 1 against."

(Taking the sales brochure first) "Equipped with a sensational breakthrough in Improbability Physics, the Heart of Gold will make you the envy of every major government. When the ship's Infinite Improbability Drive is activated, the Heart of Gold passes through every point in the universe simultaneously, making travel to any single location a breeze!"  The sales brochure goes on to describe the ship's complement of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation designed robots and computers, all equipped with GPP (Genuine People Personalities).  "Come on, let's look for the Bridge." You follow Ford, and eventually come to the...  Bridge This is the bridge of the Heart of Gold. A gangway leads down, and steam comes from an entrance to port. Next to the control console is Eddie (the shipboard computer).  At the controls, apparently expecting you and Ford, are a man with more than the usual number of heads (the name "Zaphod" is stitched on his shirt) and a dark haired woman, holding a handbag. Both seem somehow familiar. There is a molecular hyperwave pincer here.

Odd.

The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal is here, looking particularly nasty and hungry.  The Beast whips its evil smelling tail away from your nose and bellows a brain shattering roar. By suddenly popping out of nowhere you have disturbed its train of thought. However, since its train of thought was the usual one, and in fact the only one it knows, which goes like this "hungry ... hungry ... hungry ... hungry ... bad tempered ... hungry ...", it soon starts to chug along again.  You notice the Beast's Lasero Zap eyes, its Swivel Shear Teeth, and its several dozen tungsten carbide Vast Pain claws, forged in the sun furnaces of Zangrijad. It has skin like a motorway and breath like a 747. It advances on you, and roars out a demand that you say your name.

In case the significance of these fails to strike you, there is also a sandstone memorial in the middle of the courtyard, on which the Beast has roughly carved the names of all its victims. Some sharp stones lie near the exit to the west.  Bellowing with rage, the Beast charges after you.

You chip away with the stone. It's not your best writing, what with your mounting sense of panic and a towel wrapped around your head. However, it suffices...  Just as the Beast is trying to work out where you've disappeared to, it suddenly sees your name freshly carved on its memorial of remembrance. Mystery solved. It realises it must have already eaten you in a fit of absent mindedness. (Its mind is very very small and quite frequently absent.) It decides to give up the rest of its afternoon to the twin arts of digestion and contemplation. It settles down for a snooze.

You can hear nothing, smell nothing, taste nothing, feel nothing, and are not even certain who you are.  It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated. For instance, at the exact moment you said "put bit in tea" a freak wormhole opened in the fabric of the space time continuum and carried your words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle.  The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl'Hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvunt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green, sweet smelling steam. As a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, the Vl'Hurg challenged his vile enemy to take back what it had said about his mother.  The creature stirred in its sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words "put bit in tea" drifted across the conference table. Unfortunately, in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries. Eventually the error was detected, but over two hundred and fifty thousand worlds, their peoples and cultures perished in the holocaust.  You have destroyed most of a small galaxy. Please pick your words with greater care.

You've had too many drinks already, and the room is beginning to buzz...  Living Room You are in a large Living Room. There is a party going on. Other rooms lie to the west and southwest, and the apartment's front door is south of here. Phil is here. Arthur Dent is here. You notice the hostess approaching, but using several mingling couples as cover you maneuver away.

Arthur seems nice and well meaning, but also terribly shy. He has tried to start a conversation with you several times, but still hasn't gotten past "Hello."

The light resolves itself into the bright orange Sun of Damogran.  The pain at the back of your eyes is from partying until very late last night, and both your heads are suffering the worst hangover you've ever experienced. You remember formulating a plan to steal the Heart of Gold, but you can't for the life of you remember any details.  Presidential Speedboat, in the pilot seat You are piloting the speedboat, which features very simple controls, toward the island of France (Footnote 3), where the dedication ceremonies for the Heart of Gold will occur. You are currently steering the boat toward a narrow channel between towering cliffs and a rocky spire. There is a tool box here. (outside the pilot seat)

The crowd bursts into applause as the boat reaches the top of the cliff, just south of the ceremonial dais.

The light resolves itself into the bright yellow Sun of Earth.  You are hurrying up a country lane. The sky is light and clear, but you keep glancing at it with apprehension because you know that it will shortly be torn apart by Vogon ships, and that the hills and trees around you will just burn up and blow away, and you hope there's time for a quick drink beforehand.  You want to hitch a ride aboard the Vogon fleet, but are anxious because it's so long since you were through a matter transference beam.  Country Lane The road runs from Arthur's home, to the north, toward the village Pub, to the west.

Front of House Before you is the house of your friend, Arthur Dent, who is lying in front of a bulldozer; you have no idea why.

There seems to be a bit of an atmosphere.

give towel to Arthur
Inexplicably, Arthur takes no notice of the towel which, magnificently, you are trying to return to him. Instead, he says, "Ford, what about my home?"  You start guiltily. Does he actually KNOW that the Earth is about to be destroyed? You start to ask him, then stop. If he knows, what the Zark is he doing lying here in the mud in front of...  You look around. You notice the bulldozer properly for the first time. You notice Arthur's house. You notice the workmen. The penny drops. His HOUSE is about to be demolished. You feel like a complete...what's the word?
idiot
Thank you. An idiot is exactly what you feel like.  In a reckless moment you go completely mad and decide that you ought to take Arthur with you. You try to tell Arthur about the importance of getting a drink, but he's rambling on about a man called Prosser.
walk around bulldozer
You walk around the bulldozer. Prosser is standing here, looking cross and frustrated. Realising that you are a friend of Arthur's he starts to talk at you. He says that this sort of protest is all very well, but what Mr. Dent must realise is that he's had plenty of time to make a formal protest at the proper time and place, and that spending months going through the appropriate official channels, filling in the appropriate official forms, and going to the appropriate official public hearings is the right way of going about it, and lying around whimsically in the mud is not. He says that he personally hates mud and despises the sort of people who lie in it.
Prosser, lie in the mud
Prosser blinks in astonishment. "You mean, go and lie in the mud in his place...?" You explain that Arthur will only move if someone else takes over for him. Prosser shakes his head in such a manner as to suggest that he is very weary of the world, and you tactfully forebear from mentioning that it won't be troubling him much longer. Reluctantly, he follows you back toward Arthur.  You rapidly conclude the business. Prosser lies in the mud. Arthur, bewildered, nevertheless stands up and appears ready to follow you to the Pub.

w
Pub There is a barman serving at the bar. Behind the bar is a shelf. It is full of the sort of items you find on shelves behind bars in pubs. Arthur follows you.
buy beer
You order six pints of bitter    three for you, three for Arthur. According to The Hitchhiker's Guide this should cushion your system against the coming shock of the matter transference beam.  As you drink the first pint, you mention to Arthur that you are from a different planet, but it makes little impression. This surprises you, because you thought it was the sort of thing that would interest people.
buy peanuts
You buy some peanuts, which you'll need to replace protein loss from the matter transference beam, a tip you picked up from The Hitchhiker's Guide.
drink beer
It goes down well. At least they managed to get something right on this benighted planet. You decide it's time to tell Arthur that the world is about to end. You tell him. Arthur is completely unperturbed. Curious. You wonder what sort of news it would take to disturb him.
drink beer
It goes down well. You hear a muffled crash. It's probably Arthur's little house getting knocked down, which you tell him. This DOES upset him, and he tears out the door.  Through the window, you see him running up the lane. A small dog chases after him, yapping, and he throws it a cheese sandwich. The dog devours the sandwich with passion, and ignores a passing microscopic space fleet.

You reach the site of what was Arthur's home. It is now a pile of rubble. Mr. Prosser looks sheepishly triumphant, a trick few people can do, as it requires a lot of technically complex deltoid muscle work.  Front of House Arthur Dent is here. Mr. Prosser, from the local council, is standing at the side of the bulldozer. He seems to be wearing a digital watch.

Time is very, very short. Storms break in the wake of the ships, the wind whips at you and makes it difficult to stand. You grab hold of a tree.
z
Time passes...  The vast yellow ships thunder across the sky, spreading waves of terror and panic in their wake. The voice of the Vogon Captain slams across the country, insisting that the planning charts and demolition orders have been available at the local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty years and it's too late to start making a fuss about it now.  You remove the electronic Sub Etha signaling device from your satchel. Lights pulsate across its surface. You fumble with the Thumb as you hold onto the tree against the fierce wind. It falls to the ground near Arthur's feet. Arthur is struggling desperately towards you. The end of this planet is now only seconds away.

Time passes...  Fierce gales whip across the land, and thunder bangs continuously through the air in the wake of the giant ships. You struggle to reach the Thumb, but the wind is too fierce and you are driven back. Fortunately, at this point, Arthur picks up the Thumb, and somehow manages to push the right button.  However often you do it, you are still stunned by the shock of dematerialisation. The scene around is ripped away like a flimsy backcloth. Everything becomes...  Dark

You can also see a mannequin dressed in a pirate costume, a mannequin dressed in a cowboy costume and a mannequin dressed in a gladiator costume here.  What now

Attic Observatory You conclude that this must be some kind of observatory, after all, what else could it be? However, why is it that instead of the usual dome, the roof just has a strangely patterned window? Also, instead of the normal studs and crossbeams, the exposed wooden beams of the walls are set at bizarre angles. It gives you the impression that you are inside a large multi sided mathematical shape. An opening leads south.  Completing the scene is a large strangely shaped telescope. A green gas is pouring out of it.  A strange greenish gas pours out of the telescope. The gas mask protects you from the gas.  What now

As you gaze through the telescope, the patterned lens seems to cancel out the patterned window, as well as the greenish gas giving you a clear view of the night sky.  You suddenly realise that the sun hasn't set yet but you can clearly make out all the various stars. Wait a second... the stars are moving! They are moving aside, to let something else come up from beyond them. An intensely alien presence awaits, tearing at the very fabric of the physical universe, waiting for something to happen to let it in. A cold chill runs down your spine as you realise that the presence has turned its attention to you. You can feel its scrutiny as its eyes focus on you.  With a muffled cry, you recoil back from the telescope, collapsing on the floor. Monstrous thoughts bombard your mind as you flail on the floor. An overwhelming feeling of anticipation overcomes you. A sense of impending freedom, a longing for vengeance, a hunger for your very soul. You scream out loud, in an attempt to block the flood of emotions, but you cannot. To escape the steady flow of nightmares, your mind mercifully collapse into unconsciousness.  You awake later and struggle to your feet. You notice you are carrying something new amongst your possessions.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]  What now

"Your death will provide me with the key to infinite knowledge. Mankind is not the first race to hold mastery over this planet.

Its seems to be a cut out of a review of a theatre show. As you quickly read it through, one section in particular seems to stand out:  ...but the highlight of the show must have been the performance of the half time act of Marcilax, Master of Magicks. His acts of illusion and prestidigitation were simply wondrous and astounding to behold. Fortunately this reviewer had time to interview Marcilax after the show. When complimented on his performance, Marcilax modestly informed this reviewer that his success was partly due to the setting itself. To quote him "...this very theatre seems to be a storehouse of mystical energy. Normally when an abundance of mystical energy is centred in one place it will condense into crystals of immense powers, but here in this theatre it seems to be dispersed into the very walls. However one must still be careful, if I was not protected by the enchantments weaved into my protecting medallion, my very soul could be in jeopardy."

The amulet gently glows as you walk through the archway.  Witch's Lair Beyond the archway lies a small circular room of red brick, shaped, oddly enough, like an Eskimo's igloo. Dominating the centre of the room is an old iron cauldron, filled with an unknown bubbling liquid. All around the walls are shelves filled with curious little vials and other knick knacks that seem to give you the impression of a witch's secret laboratory or the like. The only exit appears to be back to the northwest through the archway.  To the side of the room against the wall is a large bronze statue of a female with four arms.

Ceremony Room The hallway opens out into a huge cavernous room, brightly lit by a large sphere of light which floats above the centre of the floor. Standing beside the light is a tall thin woman.  "Perfect timing", she cackles, moving closer to you.  Rough hands grab you from behind, and a smell of rotting flesh assails you. You struggle but cannot break free of the vice like grip. You can clearly see the features of the woman now, as she faces you. Her eyes are solid black while her pale skin seems to be tightly stretched over her narrow undernourished face, giving an almost skeletal appearance. It is almost impossible to tell her age but you get the impression of great antiquity.  She smiles coldly at you. "Your marrow smells so sweet, but I must restrain myself. Your death serves a higher purpose."  She reaches out and rummages through your pockets eventually pulling out the jewelled dagger. She brings back the dagger, then slashes down at your face. You feel the blade slice through the flesh of your face leaving a hot searing wound. You can feel your blood running down your face and neck.  The room darkens as the light sphere turns bright red.  "Your blood summons the old one. A path is formed and a new gate will open. It will be drawn to this planet now by the taste of your soul."  Suddenly her voice falters as she stares at the dagger.  "That's the wrong crystal", she shouts. She turns and runs towards the light. "Forgive me, Great One. I did not know. I was tricked!"  The light sphere suddenly turns bright blue and shrinks quickly to the size of a ping pong ball. A wind seems to blow towards the small sphere of light.  "No! Please," the woman whimpers. "I don't want to go back. I want to live forever."  The wind blows stronger and the woman seems to fall into the light and vanish. You are released by your captor, but before you can do anything, this wind seems to pick you up and throw you into the light.  [Press any key to

Grunk ask gnome how Grunk can make fire.  "There are many different ways to make fire," Gnome say. "You can use flint and steel, if you have them. They say you can rub two pieces of wood together, but I've never had much luck with that." Then gnome say, "Or you could just use alchemy. But whichever you use, be careful not to make a mess with all that soot and ash."  Gnome put tool back in box.

PLAY WHISTLE
Tweeeeeeeeeeee!  Gnome wander in from side tunnel.  "There you are, Grunk," gnome say. "I had a suspicion you might get lost here, so I thought I'd better check in on you."  Gnome not wearing stripe dress and slipper anymore. Now him wearing blue suit with jacket and pointy shoe and two little strap for keeping pants up. Think maybe Grunk see suit like that before some place, but not remember for sure. Gnome dragging trunk behind him, too.  Gnome walk over to Grunk. Give trunk to Grunk. Think that means carrying it Grunk job now.  "It was a good idea to use the whistle. It certainly made finding you easier." Gnome start walking toward tunnel that Grunk not try yet. Him look back and say, "Well, c'mon. I'll show you the way out."  Gnome go southeast.
SOUTHEAST
Probably New Tunnel This really tricky place. It all twisty and dark. Think even pig confused.  Gnome here, waiting for Grunk.  "I've decided it's time to quit being a hermit," gnome say. "I suppose in some way, you're responsible for that.  Even if you didn't quite leave everything in perfect condition, you still helped me out." Gnome stop and think. Grunk think gnome thinking about what way to go. Then gnome look back at Grunk and say, "So, thanks."  Gnome climb down into hole in ground.
ENTER HOLE
Some Other Cave There still lots of different tunnel here that go every way Grunk can see. Not really know where Grunk at, but Grunk think gnome know, and that good enough for Grunk.  Gnome here, waiting for Grunk.  Gnome say to Grunk, "It's been too long since I've done anything that really mattered. But I've got some new ideas, and I think they could be big. Bigger than mossfuressence, even."  Gnome look left and right. "Come on, we're going this way," him say. Then him duck into little tunnel that go south. Walking around in tunnel seem so easy for gnome. Him even talking at same time and still not get lost at all.

The animal stink is rank and close. You raise your crossbow, try to peer beyond dark, wet stone.
cock crossbow
You pull down the lever, winching the string back until it locks.  Something shifts in the darkness ahead, a great silent bulk. Your prey.
shoot prey
Tunk. And you flinch at the hissing shriek that echoes down the cave walls. The dark shape retreats, scrambling away, as your thudding pulse slows.  Moments later, barely sensed, the scent of blood. You have wounded the Wumpus.
left
You advance into the chamber. A bat flutters in your face. You swipe it away... and three more bats replace it. You duck, swearing; swearing again at a sharp nip on your arm. Drew blood, it did.  There is a rustling all around you. You try to remember what you know about the habits of cave bats     Oh.  You scramble back, covering your eyes; too late. The swarm is on you, harrying you, small teeth and shrieks like shards of glass. You cannot see. You are running, stumbling ahead of the storm. The Wumpus screams    too close    you thrash, flinging something blindly at the new threat, and as you recall what else you know of the hunting of bats, the floor drops away to nothing beneath you                                                                                                                                     Pain
x shape
Bottom of Pit You roll painfully to hands and knees. Ah    your arm nearly gives way    you realize you somehow tore hell out of it on the way down, or landing. It's bleeding freely.  This is the bottom of a wide pit. The walls are entirely unclimbable, of course. The floor is rippled and uneven, rising to sharp blades of stone near the edge. Mud and pebbles are strewn everywhere, but there's no standing water, so    yes    a narrow crawl leads down in the far corner.  A twisted shape lies nearby.
take rags
The old fiber tears without too much strain. You manage to rip loose some strips from the loose hems, lying clear of the corpse. What remains behind, stained with old decay, you'd just as soon not touch.  A bat flutters down from overhead. And another. You wave your arms, but they're keeping their distance.
bandage arm with rags
(the cloth strips) You quickly bind up your arm with the cloth. It stanches the bleeding, at least. You only hope that you can get to better care before infection sets in.  More bats gather.

You kneel, stiffly, and poke your head into the opening. It's tight, and it looks like it gets tighter ahead. No help for it    you crawl inside.  Tight Crawl You're on your hands and knees in a throat of stone. The roof dips even lower ahead. If you advance, it'll be squirming forwards on your belly. And squirming backwards will be impossible, you think grimly.
ahead
You hunch your elbows beneath your chest, and wiggle forward on them, into the gullet.  Tight Crawl You stop, after a long silent time, to rest. Crawling is hard work, you know well, and your aching shoulders and scraped knees attest to it. But the crawl is no different here than anywhere. You have just enough room to raise your head, and there's nothing to see ahead but more stone to crawl through.
ahead
You begin determinedly working yourself forward, again.  Tight Crawl The rock is lower above you. And narrower; you're lying full length now, your arms stretched out ahead, but still rough stone scrapes your shoulders. And you seem to be angling a bit downwards.  Icy water is trickling past you.  Your lamp flickers erratically. The moisture must be getting to its workings.
ahead
You continue. Scrabble with fingers, brace arms, push with toes. You're definitely tilted head down now. Is the stone pressing more tightly to either side of you?  Tight Crawl You lie on your side, gasping, trying to recover some strength. Your back is sore; your neck is worse. Your head aches from cracking into unexpected stone. A cold stony knot presses into your left side, your right knee.  You stretch forward once more, feeling for a few more inches before you continue.  Splash.  Your fingers are submerged in water.
ahead
You stretch your hands forward, submerging them. Hunch, stretch. Inchworm... inchworm...  Your arms are submerged, and water ripples at your chin. No room to lift your head. You turn your face to the side, cheek scraping against the damn everpresent stone, and stretch again.  Your lamp flickers once and goes out.  Tight Crawl You are lying in cold still water. It licks at your cheek and arms, and across the backs of your thighs. The chill makes your bruised knees and chest hurt all the more; your neck screams from craning high enough to breathe, but there is no room to sit up. No room to turn. No room.
ahead
You struggle on. You hope the water grows no deeper. That thought occupies you for a few more hunches, a few more stretches. Grow no deeper. If the water grows deeper... Grow no deeper. You shake that away, and nothing comes to replace it.  You crawl on in the dark. The water grows no deeper.  Maybe it's not as deep now?  Tight Crawl Water trickles over your hands, but the floor must have risen; there is less of it... a note of hope. But you cannot see.
ahead
You thrust your shoulders forward. They stick.
ahead
You push again. It's just this spot; your hands are free in a wider area ahead. But immovable stone grates against your chest and shoulders.
ahead
You've got one shoulder past the edge. The other is behind a corner of stone, and you can't imagine how it's going to get through.
ahead
You brace your legs as best you can, and shove futilely against the trap.
ahead
You brace your legs as best you can, and shove futilely against the trap.  You are never going to leave this place.
ahead
You brace your legs as best you can, and shove...  It feels like scraping flesh from bone, but your shoulder tears past the edge. You lie and gasp for a moment, and then work your torso painfully through the gap.  The passage slants sharply down now, but it's widening. It's widening. You half crawl, half slide downward, dragging your legs out of the gap, and come to rest in what seems like blinding light                                                                                                                                    Exhaustion

Smallish Cave Eventually, you manage to sit up and look around.  You are in a smallish roundish cave. Gravel and small rock chips cover the ground. Water trickles audibly, somewhere nearby. A path runs right, a steep crack heads left, and a pit climbs up.

The passage opens abruptly into vast space.  Base of Canyon You are in an alcove, a side chamber at the base of a vaulting canyon. The walls spread upward around you. And the distant roof is hung with glimmering stars    droplet tipped stalactites in some hidden suffusion of light. You think, against your will, that it was worth it.  A crevice runs along the canyon at your feet. You can cross it and continue on ahead, or re enter the crawl behind you.  The Wumpus certainly fled this way: a pool of thick, dark, reeking blood is spilled across the ground. Bats crawl all around it    rustling, fluttering, feasting.
x pool
The pool is clotted and dark, nearly black in this dim light. It is bitter and foul; it already smells of decay. And bats squat all around it.

You carefully unwrap the cloth from your arm. The worst of the bleeding has stopped, although there is still a fierce ache and a slow trickle of blood.

A cluster of bats flickers after you, chittering. You hunch your shoulders and try to ignore them.  You heave yourself wearily over the crevice, and approach the twisted formations that make up the far canyon wall...  And you round a pillar, and stop there. Here? Now?  Canyon Wall Massive buttresses of stone rise all around you, climbing the canyon wall, flowing down again in cascades of pale fluorite. A path seems to climb up among them; but you don't think you can get to it right now.  The Wumpus is crouched before you. Blood trickles from the wound your bolt tore, down its hide, puddling on the floor.  It holds your crossbow in its claws; gently cradled; loaded and cocked; steady on your throat.  The bats dive forward, then rise, emitting glass shrill cries.
wait
Time passes.  More bats are arriving, streaming across the canyon.
wait
Time passes.  The swarm grows thicker, swirling above the Wumpus, which tosses its head around angrily before returning its gaze to you.
wait
Time passes.  The Wumpus grunts, and swats at an overbold bat. The tiny shape shrieks and falls broken to the ground; but the Wumpus hisses as well, and shakes blood from its forelimb.  And the swarm descends.
ahead
You take a hesitant step sideways. And another, sliding past the beast, trying to be a thin part of the canyon wall...  The Wumpus, lashing out at bats, doesn't seem to notice.  Rising Path You are partway up the canyon wall, on a narrow path that climbs from ledge to ledge. The cavern is vast around you, water hewn strata stretching upward to the stone forest of the roof; and somewhere above you, a crack of daylight sets it all glimmering...  Down on the canyon floor, the Wumpus thrashes within a rustling black cloud. Dark growls rise to you.

Raising the Flag on Mount Yo Momma Interactive insult battle by Juhana Leinonen Release 3 / Serial number 100228 / Inform 7 build 5Z71 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N)  This game is free software.

Dance floor (center of the club) This is the center of the Compass Club. Most people don't orient themselves in relation to compass directions, but here it's more than natural. A huge compass rose is painted to the ceiling and the abbreviations of cardinal directions are painted on the walls.  To north there's the stage. You can challenge Gus by just climbing on it. The club continues in every other direction.  It looks as if somebody in a dark corner table to the southeast is making a "come here" gesture.

"You blew it up there, kid," the stranger says. "Blew it big time."  You feel your cheeks getting red. "Oh yeah? Who are you to judge?"  You're about to get up but he raises his hand. "I speak from experience. But don't worry, kid, I see you have potential. The game is not over yet. I can help you win the championship. If you're up for it."  "Who... Who are you?"  He leans forward into the spotlight and reveals his face. An eyepatch covers the old man's right eye and a wide scar runs below it, from the right temple to the left side of his neck. You jolt backwards, not because of the grotesque sight, but because you recognize him.  It's Joe Mahma.

"Uh... Yo momma's so ugly because her face is so ugly..."  "I see we have a lot of work ahead of us," he remarks dryly.  "Joe Mahma! No way!" you gasp.  "I see you know me, kid. Good to know somebody still does."  Of course you know who Joe Mahma is. Everybody knows Joe Mahma. He's a living legend, the infamous grandmaster of Yo Momma insult battles.  "Look, kid, you want my help or not?"
yes
"Ok then. Listen carefully. I know and you know you're not ready to take Gus head on. But here's the thing. A sharp tongue is all good and fine but when you really want to knock your opponent off their feet you have to strike hard. And nothing hurts more than truth. You follow me?"  "Not really," you confess.  "Pay attention now! Do some reconnaissance. Dig out some facts and use them against him. When you have enough information, just think of what you have learned and the right insult will come to you. Got it?"  "Snoop around for embarassing facts, draw inspiration from them. Got it."  "That's the spirit! Go for it, kid!"

"Hey Vincent," you say. "Word on the street is that yo momma's so poor she doesn't have any money."  Vincent stops in his tracks. You can hear gears turning in his head. He turns around, grabs you by the collar and lifts you in the air. "Who's been sayin' that? Talk ya little punk!"  Good ol' Vincent. No matter how lame the insult, you can count on him getting agitated.

With no victories so far she still has a long road ahead of her!"  Gus stomps on his side of the stage and turns to face you. The crowd goes silent.

Yo momma's so fat she has a large belly..."  The crowd is cheering, and they're cheering for you.  "The challenger wins! She is now one third on her way to becoming the champion!

However, time is on our side.  We will pull back from Deephome and allow the spirits to either leave, or stay and become bound to the place.  If that happens, I trust that whoever returns to confront them will receive this letter and understand that a certain Tome from the library called Fresto's Exorcisms and Tasty Hors Devours will explain how to dispel the spirits.   Courage and the peace of Kraxis be with you."

In the outer wide area that leads to the gates of the city, there are several low walls designed to function as defensive points should enemies enter in here.  To the west is an intersection.  The actual city gates are to the southeast.  [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

City Gates The city gates stand closed, allowing some sunlight to filter into the immediate room.  The doors are always closed when a city is abandoned, so that interlopers do not come in and desecrate the holy places.  A heavy chain connected to a series of gears and a control panel are used to open the gate which lies to the south.  The guard post stands defensively to the northwest.  The Gates block the way out of the city of Deephome.  [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

Deephome Entrance Tall pine trees stand all about, somewhat obscuring the large cave entrance into Deephome.  After three hundred years the original main road has grown over quite a bit.  There is a signpost here and a road leading west and south.  The cave's entrance leads north.  The heavy gates stand open, admitting you into Deephome.

Southern Road The tree lined southern road winds on for several miles and finally ends at the south in a little town called Ember.  To the north it leads to Deephome.

Wooded Path Trees stand along the sides of this road, their branches hanging low above the hard packed dirt.  Acorns are sparsely scattered in the grass among the leaves.  One rather large tree is here, with very low hanging branches.  You can see a squirrel here.  The small furry creature looks around for something to eat. The squirrel avoids you.
s
Town of Ember This small town looks as if it isn't very old.  The buildings, though small and ramshackle, all have fresh paint on them and the parts that are falling off seem due to poor craftsmanship instead of time.  There are some shops to the west, a town square to the south, and a road leads north.

Shops These shops seem in somewhat better condition than the rest of the town, especially the carpenter's.  However, all of the doors are closed and signs reading "Closed due to wild Eranti" adorn almost all.  To the east is the town proper.

Ember's Town Square The town square is rather beautiful, with several benches and a quaint covered well in the middle.  Some rose bushes grow about the perimeter, forming a sort of hedge that defines the square.  To the west is a small shop with a picture of a hammer on it, and a small shack lies to the east.  The main town lies to the north, and a small pond is south.

The young man behind the counter looks up over his book casually and then looks down.  He quickly does a double take, realizing that you are a dwarf, and drops the book.  Recovering immediately from his shock, the man picks the book up and casually returns to his reading, every once in a while stealing a glance over the top of the volume.  Ember Tool Shop This tool shop is quite unique in your travels in that it actually is functional.  A young and somewhat intelligent looking human is standing behind the counter, reading a thick book.  The walls are covered with all kinds of tools from hammers to saws to wrenches and claws.  The doorway leads east to the town square.  You can see a Young Man and a hammer here.  The owner runs his fingers through his hair and taps his foot a bit.

look up Partaim in Fresto
Mysterious apparitions that usually cling to places filled with money.  They have a tendency to curse anyone who tries to take what they consider their own.  However, a simple exorcism spell can remove them.  Simply spread a net on the ground and place a gold coin in it.  Pour water on the net and then take back the coin.  Then, after praying to Kraxis, speak the magical word "Manaz."  Prayer being essential first.

One of the sons of Hashar, a dark creature that was cursed to reside only in spirit form.  Upon study of his powers, the magician Fresto deduced that he is of the class of spirits known as Ternalim.

These spirits are quite pesky and are rather hard to do away with.  However, the following recipe for banishment is usually foolproof:  Take a coin and put it before the spirit.  Pour water on the coin. Put the ashes of a blank paper on the coin.  Then place a four leaf clover on the coin.  Finally, after praying to Kraxis, speak the word "Manaz."  Prayer is essential, for any utterance of this word without protection will cause certain death.

One of the daughters of Hashar, cursed to exist only in spiritual form.  Upon the study of her powers, the magician Fresto determined her to be of the spirit class Yetzuiz.
look up Yetzuiz in Fresto
Extremely rare spirit that is deeply benevolent and meek to the point of self sacrifice.  These spirits are, however, rarely very powerful and need not be feared at all.  Exorcising them, is therefore, a dirty business.  It is suggested that some living animal be given to the spirit to allow it to inhabit.  Older means of destroying benevolent spirits are available, but I do not see the need to present them here.  A note is scribbled on the bottom of the page:  "Leshosh has excellent advice on how to catch small animals under the individual animals' topics."

Squirrels are a common sight in both the forests and semi wooded areas of the world.  Their diet consists of assorted nuts, but especially acorns.

This has never been your favorite part of the city.  Nor is this neighborhood the safest one.  But as a city sanitarian, you are charged with completing an annual health and safety inspection of every restaurant in your district.  Each day you visit three or four restaurants.  During those visits you take note of potential health code violations in your trusty notepad.  Today's first target:  Nikolai's Bar and Grill.  A hazy sun barely peeks above the three story tenements.

A green awning shades the smudged window into Nikolai's dining room.  The front entrance is north of you.  The east/west sidewalk here is cracked and uneven, pocked by clumps of crabgrass.  A storm gutter is built into the curb, littered with broken bottles.  Across the street a neon sign flickers erratically.  A few cars are parked nearby (including yours), but otherwise you see no evidence that anyone visits this neighborhood past daybreak.  An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.  A damp sheet of newspaper has blown up against the curb.

(first opening the front door)  Dining Room The restaurant area of Nikolai's is relatively small:  no more than a dozen four top tables, many still littered with yesterday's crumbs.  A larger bar area  the primary source of revenue here  lies to the east.  A rickety staircase leads to small balcony outside Nikolai's office loft.  A wide mirror is mounted on the wall high above, right near his office entrance.  On the south end of the room, a long window provides an unattractive view of the street.  The galley kitchen is north of here.  An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.  Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.  An obese man (Nikolai, the owner?) watches you from the balcony.  "Who's there?  Tell him we're closed" Nikolai growls in disgust.  Angela cowers, "I think he's the man from the health department."  She looks at you "We're not open right now."  Nikolai growls again, "We were just inspected six months ago.  Tell him to go away."  Without waiting for an answer from either you or Angela, Nikolai turns back into his office and closes the door.  Angela shrugs helplessly, and begins cleaning the dining room.  [Nikolai's sanitation rating has dropped three points.]

The tables are four tops.  None of twelve tables have been cleaned since last night.  Angela begins wiping tables.  Angela says, "You mustn't take Nikolai too seriously.  He's really a very good man.  It's just... he acts kind of grumpy sometimes because of his affliction.

Angela whispers, "When Nikolai started gaining a lot of weight, about fifteen years ago, his doctor diagnosed him with the affliction.  You know, that blood sugar disease?  He takes insulin for it, I think."

Bar Sunlight from the 19th Street window (south) casts an bright trapezoid across the cork dance floor.  In every other corner, the brick walls of this unpretentious watering hole are marked by shadows.  If you don't mind risking ptomaine poisoning, Nikolai's dining room is to the west.  Otherwise, the unisex lavatory is north through a low ceiling tunnel.  A set of Naugahyde stools are pushed against the linoleum bar.  Behind the bar is a dinky two basin sink with an attached faucet.  In the rinse basin is some ice.  Beside the sink is a personal stereo (held together largely with duct tape).

While sifting through the ice in the rinse basin, you pause in horror.  Buried near the drain is a severed human hand.

Lavatory The low ceiling restroom is painted yellow, the color of urine and bile.  Its only fixtures are a porcelain toilet, hand sink, soap dispenser and automatic hand dryer, all mounted low to the floor as if they were reclaimed from an abandoned grade school, or this lavatory was designed for alcoholic ten year olds.  A Jackson Pollack pattern of vomit is splashed across the back wall of the bathroom, certainly nowhere near the toilet where it was presumably aimed.

Galley Kitchen You are in a galley kitchen about eight feet long, and just wide enough for one person to turn around.  On the south side facing the dining room is a wooden prep table.  On the left end of the prep table is a mini fridge, and on the right end is a steam table.  Opposite the prep table is a flat grill.  Dried rivulets of grease ooze down the wall from the overhead vents.  A narrow aisle winds north into darkness.

Refrigerator Nikolai's walk in refrigerator is kept at a few degrees above zero Celsius.  The tight dimensions of this poorly lit unit induce a sense of claustrophobia.  The textured metal walls are splashed with now dry remnants of long ago dinner specials.  The exit back to the winding hall is east.  A five gallon soup cauldron is pushed carelessly into one corner.  A four tier wire shelf supports an assortment of hotel pans in varied sizes and depths.

Dish Room On entering the dish room you are overwhelmed by the astringent smell of fresh bleach.  You would welcome this as evidence of sanitation, except that in such high concentrations bleach is actually toxic.  Already you're feeling a little nauseous.  A hall winds south into the darkness.  A manhole size drain cover is set in the floor.  A warped wooden door is set into the cement north wall. The door is sealed tight.  The largest fixture in this location is a straight unit dish machine, with a stainless steel dish table on either side.  On the dish table is a dish rack (in which are some servingware).  You note a rat out of the corner of your eye.

Dining Room An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.  Angela is gaunt and anemic.  She struggles to remain alert.  Nikolai pokes his head out from the top office, "Angela, be a peach and pick up some bread from the food pantry."   Angela looks puzzled "You mean the 5th Avenue Mission?"   "Of course that's where I mean.  Our regular bread company won't deliver here anymore.  Just go to the food pantry and fill up your car."   "I can't take food from a homeless shelter."   Nikolai's face turns red, "We need bread, and you can get it free from the mission.  Tell them you're a homeless wench.  Tell them you've got twelve screaming brats to feed.  I don't care.  If you won't go there, then go to the store and pay for the bread with your own money, but don't come back without it!"   Angela lowers her head.  She looks like she's about to cry.   As Angela leaves the restaurant, you notice a small flashlight fall off of her key chain.  A cockroach scuttles up the wall.

Winding Hall A narrow hall twists and winds from the prep kitchen (south) to the dish room (north).  A walk in refrigerator is west of here.  During every dinner shift, smoke from the kitchen drifts down this hall and deposits an oily film against the brown wall.  Mounted on the wall is a first aid kit.  A formidable buffalo chopper is parked against one corner of this twisting labyrinth. This machine probably harbors more than a hundred varieties of pathogens and therefore deserves quite careful attention.

(first opening the drain cover)  Crypt The edges and corners of this brown room are rounded by accumulated cobweb nets, making it look more like a small cave than an urban underground.  Moldy pylons and concrete extrusions resemble stalagmites.  Wet cardboard boxes stacked along the wall contain empty unrecycled liquor bottles.  The humid air smells of death.  You could escape through the drain pipe in the ceiling.  At the center of the room is a three foot by six foot sealed crate, composed mostly of particle board.
open crate
Your first reflex is to gag.  Inside is the dismembered body of an adult female.  Her arms and legs have been removed, her abdomen sliced open and disemboweled.  Where her eyes were once, empty sockets remain.  Having been drained entirely of blood, her skin is now as pale as the clean cotton bed sheet draped across her pelvis.  She lifts her head, and knocks it three times against the bottom of the box.  But no, you must have imagined that.  She is dead.  Quite dead.

x chopper
The chopper is old, covered in rust.  Drops of fresh blood leak out from the food trough in places where it has rusted completely through.  The device has an on/off button, and the rotating trough which is designed to carry large volumes of food past a stationary blade.  It isn't quite large enough to accommodate a full size buffalo.  But a rabbit or a small dog, perhaps.  The buffalo chopper is switched off.

For this to be a really thorough inspection, you'll need to open the chopper and examine the blade.

The blade is hidden by a protective cover.

The screw is rusted in place.  Your only other alternative for inspecting the blade is to reach in the trough.
reach in chopper
You reach under the cover of the trough and cautiously poke around.  Wedged against the blade is a pulpy mass of sinewy entrails.  With some effort, you jerk the entrails free from the blade.  Suddenly, and without warning, the buffalo chopper roars to life.  Your sleeve catches against the rusty blade, which stalls momentarily, but seizes your arm deeper into the device.  Then the blade spins once again.  At first you're not even sure what has happened, but you hear a crunching noise, and feel faint from a sudden drop in blood pressure.  With a rush of endorphins, you yank your arm free from the buffalo chopper, and collapse on the floor.  You are missing a hand.  If you don't act quickly, you will die.

Dining Room An aluminum placard is fixed to the front door.  Since the last time you were here, Nikolai has managed to transport himself down those treacherous steps to the Dining Room.  He sits on one of those tiny dining room chairs, which appears barely capable of supporting his weight.  Angela has returned from her bread run.  She sits across Nikolai's lap, scarcely conscious, with just a trace of blood dribbling from twin teeth marks in her neck.  Nikolai looks up from her neck, with blood stains on his own fat face, "You're next, Mr. Health Inspector.  I knew you'd cause me trouble when you walked in here."  Since your last tour through the dining room, Nikolai has locked and barred the front door to prevent your escape.
u
Nikolai pursues you up the stairs, huffing and wheezing from the effort.  You double your speed just in time to escape his reach.  Nikolai is left stranded and out of breath back on the fifth step.  Nikolai's Office Nikolai's office is an ill maintained balcony sky box above his restaurant.  A window looks out over the restaurant. But as you could see earlier, the dining room side is mirrored such that employees and guests can't see in.  A rickety set of steps leads back to the main floor.  The plaster walls are water stained and cracked.  A single unfrosted bulb hangs from the ceiling by a loose wire.  Mounds of unpaid invoices litter Nikolai's wooden desk.  On Nikolai's desk are a brass key and a book.  A plastic pitcher sits on the floor in the corner of the office, filled with some foamy amber liquid.  Your heart is racing.

read book
(First taking the book.) Taken.  You read: "Lore of the Vampires".  Two chapter titles catch your attention:  "Vampire Culture" and "Killing Vampires".  Most of the remaining chapters are written in an unfamiliar Slavic language.
read killing
You read: Killing Vampires  Methods for warding or killing a vampire are so widely known, they are now almost cliché.  For warding:  either a wreath of garlic or a wooden cross worn around the neck should effectively ward off both the Bratislavan and Transylvanian type vampires.  For killing, only a weapon made of silver has any permanent effect.  Of course one is not likely to find these implements (garlic, crosses, or silver weapons) in the vampire's own abode.  This creates a problem for Bratislavan vampires who desire nothing so much as to kill and dominate their rivals.  They achieve this without the use of silver (which might be turned against them) by dismembering their opponents and scattering the remaining parts as widely as possible.  Yet even this gruesome ritual is impermanent.  The dismembered parts of a vampire retain their own force of will, and strive to reassemble themselves by whatever means available.
read culture
You read: Vampire Culture.  Bratislavan vampires, like their Transylvanian cousins, require nightly aliquots of blood for their continued immortality.  But unlike the Transylvanians, who are mostly solitary in habit, the Bratislavan vampires fight actively amongst themselves for territory, a stable of victims and general dominance.  The most dominant vampire in a given territory is the arch vampire.

Even the lungs gasp for another breath.   Then, as if these miracles weren't startling enough, The entire abdomen zips shut, leaving nothing more than a scar.

severed right leg: Almost before you release it, the right leg wriggles snakelike into location below the woman's torso.  Muscle and sinew, then skin all regenerate between the disjointed limb and body.  The air crackles.  Your nose burns with the stench of cauterized flesh.  The woman flexes her right leg. She coos, "it still tingles.  But Sugar, you must still bring me my foot."  severed left leg: You hear a sudden crack, like bone breaking in reverse.

She coos, "it still tingles.  But Honey, you must still bring me my hand."  severed left arm: Sofia looks with excitement as you lower the final limb into her coffin.  She leans toward you so that the left arm locks into exactly the right place.  The air crackles more loudly than before, filling the entire room with the smoke and stench of cauterization.

"You have done good work today, my little hero.  And since I fancy you, I will now help you escape." "But first, won't you give me a little kiss?
no
Sofia is saddened.  "That isn't the answer I had hoped for, but I shall respect your choice.  "You are a sharp fellow.  By now I expect you've figured out the situation on your own and I don't have to belabor my strained relationship with Nikolai.  We are both, to put it crudely, vampires.  When I moved into the neighborhood a few years ago, he still had the power to subordinate me.  But I knew he was being weakened by diabetes and it would not be long before I would inherit his territory.  Nikolai knew this as well.  So to prevent my challenge to his dominance he had me abducted and slaughtered."  Sofia smiles.  "Now, I suppose, is the time for my revenge."

You ask each offender if they know anything. You promise a lighter sentence for the ones who help. But one guy really sets you straight. "I got caught wit' t'ree ounces o' crack. I'm supposed to get 20 years but I'll be out in 2. You can't make me talk cuz it don't matter to me. If I squeal, da guys who did it are gonna come lookin' for me. I know but I ain't gonna tell ya.

up
You remember darkness. And the cold. Cold and darkness. And silence. Those memories are all that you have. That, and a feeling that something you never knew you possessed has been lost.  Suddenly, oblivion is split by a blinding light and a crash of sound. You awaken to the roar of a storm and a deluge of rain and mud.  The Awakening Copyright (c) 1998 by Dennis Matheson (For more information type "HELP", for hints type "HINTS")  Release 1 / Serial number 980726 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7  In the Mud Rain and muddy water are pouring down on you, making it difficult to see or even breathe. Sodden earth and mud surrounds you on all sides except overhead, where flashes of lightning illuminate a storm tossed sky.
u
As you scramble out of the hole the mud collapses downward, filling in the hole behind you.  Graveyard Dozens of stone markers stand here, oblivious to the wind and the rain. Huge, twisted oaks, their limbs tossed by the wind, draw an unmentionable sustenance from the moss covered, moldy ground. An odor of decay, which even the storm cannot dissipate, hangs over everything. An iron barred fence surrounds the graveyard, an ivy covered barrier separating it from the world of the living. The only exit is through the gate to the east.  A church rises to the east, its boarded up windows giving the impression that it is covering its eyes from the sight of the graveyard.  A large branch has been broken from one of the trees and has crushed the grave marker below it.

West Side of the Church This side of the church is untended and grasses and weeds have run rampant. A muddy trail leads back to the graveyard to the west and on to the southeast and a faint path continues around the church to the northeast.  To the east, the wall of the church breaks some of the force of the wind.  Lightning arcs overhead, followed instantly by a blast of thunder.
se
Front of the Church Two massive oak trees which flank the cracked sidewalk dominate the front of the church. The facade of the church itself rises beyond them, its steeple silhouetted against the sky. The storm lashes at its faded white facade, almost as if the storm is trying to wash the church clean; something you somehow realize will take more than mere water to accomplish. To the north, a sidewalk leads to the front of the church. A weed choked driveway runs to the northeast and down a hill to the south, and a muddy path leads around the church to the northwest.  The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it. A formidable looking guard dog stands here.  The dog growls at you threateningly.

The south wall of the church looms blankly overhead.  The dog chases madly after you!
e
East Side of the Church This wide, graveled clearing may have once been where the worshippers at the church left their vehicles while attending services inside. If so, it seems that the last service was held long ago. Weeds and grasses grow up through the gravel, which is littered with debris. Dark, looming trees surround the clearing except for the driveway, which leads to the southwest, and for a narrow opening to the northwest.  To the west, the church stares out over the clearing.  The dog chases madly after you!

Front of the Church  The church and steeple loom to the north, the open window frames seeming to stare with judgment upon anyone standing before it.  The dog lunges after you, but is suddenly jerked to a stop with a yelp.  The dog has been brought up short by it's chain, which is now completely wrapped around the church.  It barks wildly but ineffectually at you as you continue on around the corner.

Church Porch This wide, covered porch spans the width of the church front. A white picket railing surrounds the porch on three sides, except to the south where a short flight of steps leads down to the sidewalk.

Vestibule This small room is the entryway for the church. The years of neglect are obvious; the floorboards are rotten and warped and what were probably once stained glass windows are shattered and boarded up. Dirt and debris covers the floor. A set of double doors leads south back to the outside while a large archway leads north into the sanctuary. Overhead, there is an open trap door in the ceiling at about twice your height.  There is a brief rattle of hail on the roof.
n
Sanctuary Once the heart of the church this room is now cold, dark and empty. Debris is scattered among the sagging pews and only shards of broken glass remain of the stained glass windows. Most of the interior fixtures have been removed, but a large portrait of Christ stares down at you from above the archway to the south. The pulpit still stands to the north.
n
Pulpit From this raised platform you can see the entire inside of the church. The pulpit is empty except for the podium which rises from the center. A small door is visible behind the podium to the north.

Small Office This small office has the same run down appearance of the rest of the church. Debris covers the floor and a trickle of water comes in around the boards covering a broken window. A desk stands in the middle of the room and an empty bookshelf sits against one wall. A pile of ashes marks where a fire once burned in the middle of the floor. A door to the south leads back to the sanctuary.  On the desk is a journal.  A richly embroidered robe hangs beside the door.  There is a brief rattle of hail on the roof.

(the old grimoire) The book contains several rituals and procedures all involving the soul or spirit.  The first describes a ritual through which the soul can be removed from a person's body and placed in a specially prepared container. The soul remains in the container even if the person's body dies.  A second ritual can be employed to use the stored soul as a receptacle for the sin of another person.  This allows the possessor of another's soul to perform any acts they wish without having to answer for those acts in the next world.

You carefully climb up the length of railing, using the pickets like a ladder.  Steeple Chamber This small chamber is about halfway up the steeple of the church. Rain and wind from the storm outside blows in through an open window frame and water collects in puddles on the warped floor, mixing with the droppings of the birds, or perhaps bats, which can be heard fluttering around overhead. Looking up, you can see a maze of beams and supports that form the interior of the steeple. Rain pours in from an opening higher in the steeple and trickles out through a trap door in the floor.  A frayed but heavy rope hangs from somewhere overhead.  The heavy wooden door to the north is closed.  The top of the broken section of railing is visible sticking up through the trap door in the floor.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

Belfry The belfry of the church, high up inside the steeple. You are hanging from a maze of support beams and trusses with the nearest solid floor far below you. Large open frames give a view of the surrounding forest and of the town at the base of the hill. They also allow the fury of the storm to pass in unimpeded. You can see the branch of an oak tree just outside the southern frame.  A massive bell hangs here, from a damaged mount. A heavy rope is attached to the bell and hangs through the beams to the room below.

You carefully climb up the length of railing, using the pickets like a ladder.  Top of Oak Tree The limbs of the tree are swaying violently from the storm, but near the trunk it is a little more stable. You have an excellent view from here of the church grounds and surrounding area. The church seems to be in a clearing on a hill surrounded by a forest. At the base of the hill a small town can be seen, its lights glimmering faintly through the storm.   One of the branches of the tree reaches out to the north towards the steeple of the church. An open frame can be seen in the steeple near where the branch ends.  The steeple of the church looms to the north.  The broken length of railing is propped up against a nearby branch.

You push the curtain aside and pause. On the other side of the curtain is a room much like the one you are in. A figure stands in the archway, apparently about to enter your room, and it is the sight of this figure which has brought you up short. It is, or was, human... once. Now, it is a withered mass of decaying flesh. It's clothing hangs in tatters and it is caked in mud and grave mold. Patches of hair hang from it's scalp and bones are visible in places through it's skin. The only thing that remains intact are it's eyes; pale blue and now wide open and staring.  The creature raises its hand to you, and you find yourself doing the same. You reach out your arm and touch...     ...a cold unyielding surface of polished glass.    Suddenly, the realization of what you are seeing comes home to you, and you step back from the mirror with a cry.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

You pass the sentry watching the doorway to the Yi control room, hardly aware of his presence, and step inside, stopping before the owner of the familiar, frowning face just inside. Your escorts come to a halt behind you.  "Tolan," the tall, wiry woman says to you.  You steel yourself for the need to speak. "Cheryl," you reply. "Dig Leader Cheryl Thadafel. I knew you would have need of the greatest Mechanist in the galaxy. Again." The longest speech ever to cross these lips?  "Tolan, this is going to be on my terms, or not at all."  You turn your empty hands face up. "Cheryl, this is important to me. It is the Yi Lono Mordel. Whatever the restrictions, I cannot miss this opportunity."  "Especially if the restrictions required you be kept away from it. Enough. I don't have much else to work with here, do I?" As she dismisses the guards, you sweep your eyes about the room.  Again.  This time you will pull it off  regardless of Cheryl's desires.  THE WEAPON an Interactive Misdirection  Copyright 2001, Sean Barrett Release 1 / Serial number 010706 / Inform v6.21vs Library 6/10stb   Yi Lono Mordel Control Room Most humans would probably find it the height of fashion, but this low ellipsoidal room makes you uncomfortable with its perfect symmetry and sterility. The featureless white wall is broken up only by the large elliptical window in the ceiling and the circular doorway through which you entered. A cluster of forms sits in the center, atop the slightly concave floor.  Cheryl Thadafel stands here, watching you closely.

touch notch
You touch the the notch with a minimal pressure. It is cooler than the rest of the slab, and you can feel the heat from your finger being drawn out momentarily. Where no cracks had been visible before, nevertheless sections of the top of the slab give way, and a control surface slides up and clicks into place.  Cheryl says, "Ok, this is interesting." She peers at the control surface.  >
x studs
Each of the thousands of studs arrayed in a regular hexagonal packing across the control surface has a color and shape, but those two together are not enough to make each unique. However, it resembles all the other Yi mechanisms you have encountered in your life; although nobody else in the galaxy might ever realize it, the third axis of encoding is in the electric potential of the stud. Although the human body is poorly suited to the task, your long study has made you sensitive to this dimension as well. With that extra information and your encyclopedic knowledge of Yi technology, you can hazard a guess about many of these controls.  There are a number of studs whose exact function you are fairly certain you would recall if you studied them more closely and which seem relevant right now: an information stud, a powerup stud, a project status stud, a sequence stud, and a forcefield stud.  Cheryl says, "What's on that screen?" She approaches from other side of the slab. "Bah. See if you can find some text there."  >
x information stud
Activating this stud will bring up a large display on which will be shown what you imagine must be a detailed description of the purpose behind Yi Lono Mordel and information on how to use it  none of which would do you any good, since you can not read Yi writing. You are not certain that this is the information it displays, but you did activate and then deactivate this stud several months ago, so you are quite positive about it being full of Yi text.  >
x powerup stud
Activating this stud should power on and off all the major systems needed to use Yi Lono Mordel.  >
touch powerup stud
You touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  Hmm... Absolutely nothing happens. Given the years of disuse, perhaps the generator is in need of minor maintenance. You search the control surface and find a generator access stud, which should give you access to the generator so you can make any repairs necessary.  >
x project status stud
Activating this stud ought to produce some sort of more detailed display of the Yi Lono Mordel status. Knowing the way the Yi tend to compartmentalize knowledge, it will hopefully not give any detail about the point of the entire mechanism.  >
x generator access
Activating this stud should give you access to the fusion generator used to power this facility.  >
x sequence stud
Activating this toggle stud will most likely bring up a concise listing of the steps needed to use Yi Lono Mordel on the control surface viewscreen. It probably has text that Cheryl could decipher, but hopefully it includes symbolic instructions; despite your bravado, Yi Lono Mordel is on a vastly different scope that any other Yi technology you have worked with, and you'll need help getting it going  help you can not rely on Cheryl for. Unfortunately, Cheryl seems to be able to see the viewscreen pretty clearly.  >
x forcefield stud
You are no coward, but you know when you can use some help, so you always have an eye open for something like this. Activating this stud probably turns on a forcefield generator around the control slab  and Yi forcefields are nearly impenetrable by human technology. This might come in handy if Cheryl was not always so close to the slab.  >
touch information
This is the only stud you were able to activate when you were here before, and you are positive that it will produce the information Cheryl's looking for  which would make her bring today's session to a halt. It might be enough information for her to figure out what this place is; if so, you'd never get a chance to try again. So you better not activate it unless you've got some way to stop her.  >
touch generator
You touch your fingertip gently against the generator access stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  A pale green energy appears on the monitor hologram. Cheryl says, "What's that? Don't touch..."  To the right, a white pillar with an elliptical cross section slides up out of the floor.  Cheryl says, "You better know what you're doing here, Tolan."  >
reply
You say, "I'm looking for the manual override."  >
x white pillar
This looks to be the fusion generator. It is an elliptical white pillar, almost two meters tall, one meter wide, and half a meter deep. On the long front side is an access panel, which is closed.  Cheryl says, "Well, of course. I'd help, but I'm busy watching you."  >
reply
You say, "Of course."  >
touch panel
You touch your fingers to the access panel and immediately recognize the subtle flow of energy through the surface. How much easier this would be if you could see in the electromagnetic spectrum! After a moment of concentration, you align the energy in your fingertips against the flow. The access panel swings open, revealing a fusion generator bay.  Cheryl says, "What exactly is that?"  >
reply
You say, "It is a wiring crossover terminal. Something is not connected correctly."  >
x bay
The fusion generator bay is a spherical chamber which houses several Yi components you recognize comprise a plasma generator  a much bigger generator than you have ever seen in your long life  while the one remaining mechanism must be a plasma containment system  something you have always suspected the Yi were capable of, despite it being beyond your species' ability to produce. Closer inspection of the containment system reveals twelve contact points.  You recall noticing a tool stud which might give you something useful for analyzing the situation.  Cheryl says, "Oh, right, I should have recognized it."  >
x contact points
The twelve contacts are arranged around the edge of the plasma generation zone in perfect symmetry. They all look quite identical.  >
touch tool stud
You touch your fingertip gently against the tool stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  A slot appears on the top of the slab, to the left. Rising out of the slot is an electropulse probe.  Cheryl says, "What is that? Hands off, Tolan." She grabs it as it emerges.  >
wait
Time passes.  Cheryl says, "You can have this once I'm sure it's safe, Tolan."  She examines the probe carefully, then aims it so neither end is pointing at either of you, and fiddles with it for a moment.  Although you cannot see anything happening directly,  Cheryl's monitor hologram lights up with a multi colored iridescent sphere which slowly fades away.  Cheryl says, "Huh. Just an electromagnetic toy." She sets it down on the slab.  >
take probe
Taken.  >
x probe
A thin, cylindrical, half meter long rod, the electropulse probe is a common Yi device for working with certain kinds of Yi technology. The subtle interplay of electric and magnetic fields found in mechanisms can be stimulated with the probe, useful for detection, analysis, or calibration. At one end are two control sensors.  >
ask cheryl for hologram
Cheryl says, "This monitor hologram is how I'm keeping tabs on you. If I don't have it, you're not going to get to do anything, anything at all."  Cheryl thinks for a moment and then speaks again. "However, I recall we confiscated a pair of electromagnetic sensitive goggles from you back when we... found... you here." She speaks into her communicator.  Several minutes later, one of the guards stands in the doorway and tosses the goggles on the floor next to you, then leaves.  >
wear goggles
(first taking the electromagnetic goggles) You clumsily struggle to put on the electromagnetic goggles and the room suddenly bursts to life visually. Whorls and eddies of energy play over every surface of the room but the window. Although it is a far cry from being able to directly perceive this much of the electromagnetic spectrum, it is far, far more than you have been forced to live with for some time.  The one drawback is that it is difficult to read displays, since the display spectrum is compressed to such a narrow band, and the display circuitry itself is exposed.  >
x generator
(the white pillar) The fusion generator is an elliptical pillar, with small amounts of energy playing over it. Energy flows in a regulated way across an access panel, which is open, revealing a fusion generator bay.  Cheryl sighs. "Tolan, do you have any idea how important it is we figure this place out, once and for all?"  >
x bay
The fusion generator bay houses several Yi components you recognize comprise a plasma generator, while the remaining mechanism must be a plasma containment system. The containment system has twelve contact points. There is little energy flow to be seen, since the generator is off.  Cheryl says, "The problem is with the Lono, as you might guess."  >
probe contacts
You put the electropulse probe into the fusion generator bay.  You trigger the top sensor.  A sharp, multi colored burst of electromagnetic radiation pulses out of the tip of the probe.  The contact points in the fusion generator bay resonate in response  all but the ninth one, which stays utterly black. There is probably a recalibration stud for each of the contacts amongst the giant array of controls on the slab.  It is a good thing you got the goggles; the probe flash tends to overwhelm the details on Cheryl's hologram anyway.  Cheryl says, "They're coming back, Tolan. Soon, we think. So before they show up, I'm going to have found a way to put an end to it, with your help."  >
press bottom
You trigger the bottom sensor, and the ambient electromagnetic activity in the probe increases significantly.  Cheryl says, "You probably never realized it, Tolan, but the Yi had a somewhat high opinion of themselves. The word Yi isn't just their name  it means 'the end' or 'the ultimate'. The 'Yi Lono Mordel' isn't 'the Yi's Lono weapon'; it's 'the final Lono weapon'. They were planning to win their war with it."  >
wait
Time passes.  Cheryl says, "So I guess I'll finally make it into the history books by doing it for them."  >
touch calibration
Timing your action carefully, you touch your fingertip gently against the calibration stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  A sharp, multi colored burst of electromagnetic radiation pulses out of the tip of the probe.  The contact points in the fusion generator bay resonate in response.  You are confident it will power up now.  >

press powerup
You touch your fingertip gently against the powerup stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  The fusion generator pillar radiates a sequence of colors: dark red, deep purple, light blue, and then builds and peaks with a very bright yellow.  Cheryl's monitor hologram reveals significant electromagnetic activity beginning to occur within the fusion generator.  It looks like powering up was a good place to start; that was fairly obvious. But you have no intuition about what to do next with a mechanism on this scale; the grid of stud offers thousands of studs, any of which could plausibly be involved.  Cheryl says, "You're making quite a bit of progress, Tolan."  >
press project status stud
You touch your fingertip gently against the project status stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  Projected on the left half of the far wall of the room, an installation status display showing the current configuration of Yi Lono Mordel appears.  On the installation status display, the indicator corresponding to this asteroid changes color.  Cheryl says, "What's this?" She takes a step closer to it. "Shoot, no text."  >
remove goggles
You take off the goggles, revealing the drab world of the natural human visual spectrum.  >
x status display
The installation status display uses crisp, simple geometric symbols to display a representation of the entire Yi Lono Mordel installation: the star system you are in now, with the twenty asteroids including this one orbiting it, and the twenty stars arrayed around it like the vertices of a dodecahedron, each with twenty asteroids of their own. The indicator corresponding to this asteroid is glowing brighter than those for the other asteroids.  Cheryl says, "I can't imagine how you can stand wearing those bulky things. Of course they make a huge difference in what you see."  >

give goggles to cheryl
Cheryl takes the goggles from you. "Something interesting to see this way, Tolan?" She puts them on and looks around as if slightly disoriented.  >
press sequence stud
You touch your fingertip gently against the sequence stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  The viewscreen lights up with a list of Yi text and corresponding control iconography.  Although you cannot see anything happening directly,  Cheryl's monitor hologram lights up with a multi colored iridescent sphere which slowly fades away.  Cheryl, watching through the goggles, says, "Huh. Tolan, I'd never have thought you'd be one to admire beauty."  >
x viewscreen
The viewscreen is a small, perfectly square display set into the control surface. Although you can not understand the Yi writing, you can recognize a number of the control icons in the sequence: power up, then transmit go, then control rods, then ignition. Powering up you have done; no doubt there are studs to trigger the other three.  >
press sequence stud
You touch your fingertip gently against the sequence stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  The viewscreen returns to its normal display.  Cheryl says, "Is that it?" She reaches up to take off the goggles.  >
x studs
There are a number of studs whose function you are fairly certain of and which might prove relevant: a transmit stud, a control stud, an ignition stud, a calibration stud, a tool stud, a generator access stud, an information stud, a powerup stud, a project status stud, a sequence stud, and a forcefield stud.  Cheryl says, "Show's over, huh?" She takes off the goggles and tosses them on the ground beside you. Good thing they're sturdy enough to take a fair amount of abuse.  >
x transmit stud
Activating this stud no doubt transmits a signal of some sort, presumably to the other asteroids in the Yi Lono Mordel installation. Considering their ability to miniaturize, the Yi would not need an external transmission source; the transmitter is probably right inside the slab. However, given the location and energy necessary, the signal it produces will surely be visible on Cheryl's monitor hologram or through your electromagnetic goggles.  >
put probe in slab
You put the "top" end of the probe back into the slot, leaving the sensors exposed. The probe is held in place firmly, but sticks up out of the slot.  >
touch bottom
You trigger the bottom sensor.  >
touch tool stud
You touch your fingertip gently against the tool stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  The probe sinks into the slot, which closes over it.  >
touch transmit stud
Timing your action carefully, you touch your fingertip gently against the transmit stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  Cheryl's monitor hologram lights up with a burst of radiant energy from the probe and from the transmission, both interfering with each other and masked by the surroundings of the control slab.  An icon on the viewscreen changes subtly.  Cheryl says, "Tolan, my superiors don't want you anywhere near here. If they find out, I'll be in a lot of trouble."  >
touch control stud
You touch your fingertip gently against the control stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  A pair of rods slowly emerge from surface of the slab.  Cheryl says, "What are those?"  >
x rods
A pair of slender cylindrical control rods sticks up from the surface of the slab through a thin crack. The rods are about a meter apart. You have never seen anything like this in your experience with Yi equipment.  >
cheryl, pull rods
Cheryl says, "I'd rather leave my hands free to reach for my laser, Tolan. But I guess you can take the handcuffs off."  She tosses the key to the handcuffs onto the floor next to you.  >

You pull the rods together, towards each other, and they move until they are much closer. An icon on the viewscreen changes slightly. The rods want to spring back apart, and you can not do anything else while holding them together, so you release the rods.  >
put handcuffs on rods
You pull the rods together and slip the handcuffs on them. They seem to hold the rods together quite handily. An icon on the viewscreen changes slightly.  Cheryl says, "How clever."  >
press information
You touch your fingertip gently against the information stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  A large display appears on the right wall of the room, filled with line after line of Yi text.  Cheryl notices the activity and turns to look at the display. "That's it! You've found it. Wonderful!" She walks over to take a closer look at it. "Oh, Tolan, I think the first word is 'humans'! I think this might be addressed to us! The first ever communication from the Yi."  >
press forcefield
You touch your fingertip gently against the forcefield stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  Cheryl notices the activity on her hologram monitor. She turns to face you. "Tolan, you're a dead man. I told you not to mess with anything." She draws her laser pistol, but hesitates. "Hell, that's a Yi forcefield, isn't it? Well, you can't stay in there forever."  >
press ignition
You touch your fingertip gently against the ignition stud and focus your mind to concentrate your energies through it.  On Cheryl's monitor hologram, an enormous surge of energy flows out of the fusion generator and out in all directions around the room.  Cheryl looks at the monitor hologram in dismay, then turns to face you.  Cheryl says, "What are you up to, Tolan?"  >
reply
You say, "Well, it has been fun, Cheryl. But it is over now."   Cheryl says, "What do you mean?"  A speaker at the doorway crackles to life. "Dig Leader, some time ago we detected a transmission to the surrounding asteroids, and have just determined it came from the control room."  >
reply
You say, "Yi Lono Mordel is powered up and ready to go."   Cheryl says, "Ready? What is Yi Lono Mordel?"  >
reply
You say, "It is the Yi's ultimate weapon, just like you said. You remember the Lono planet buster? Yi Lono Mordel is more. Far more. It is a galaxy smasher. I think. I believe. I hope."   Cheryl stares at you silently.  >
reply
You say, "We can only assume the Yi did not use it because they did not want to wipe out humanity along with the Lono  at least, not if humanity managed to stop the Lono."  >
reply
You say, "So now I will get to do the honors."   Cheryl says, "What? Destroy the galaxy? Why?"  The voice on the speaker returns. "Also, a freighter in the area reports a signal was sent out to the neighboring stars."  >
reply
You shake your head. "Cheryl, Cheryl. Come now. Why do you think I would want to destroy all of humanity?"   Cheryl says, "I know you too well to believe you're a psychopath. So I don't know."  >
reply
You say, "You do not know me at all, Cheryl. I am different from everyone you know. Different from every human being in the galaxy, in fact. Differently motivated."  >
reply
You say, "Did your superiors suspect? Did they tell you to keep me away, or did they tell you to kill me? Tell me."   Cheryl considers replying, but hesitates.  >

Version 48 / Serial number 840904  Inside the Barrow You are inside an ancient barrow hidden deep within a dark forest. The barrow opens into a narrow tunnel at its southern end. You can see a faint glow at the far end. A strangely familiar brass lantern is lying on the ground. A sword of Elvish workmanship is on the ground.
GET LAMP AND SWORD
lamp: Taken. sword: Taken.
S
Narrow Tunnel You are standing at the southern end of a narrow tunnel where it opens into a wide cavern. The cavern is dimly illuminated by phosphorescent mosses clinging to its high ceiling. A deep ravine winds through the cavern, with a small stream at the bottom. The walls of the ravine are steep and crumbly. A foot bridge crosses the ravine to the south.
S
Foot Bridge You are standing on a crude but sturdy wooden foot bridge crossing a deep ravine. The path runs north and south from here.
S
Great Cavern This is the center of the great cavern, carved out of the limestone. Stalactites and stalagmites of many sizes are everywhere. The room glows with dim light provided by phosphorescent moss, and weird shadows move all around you. A narrow path winds southwest among the stalagmites, and another leads northeast. A strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard. The Wizard draws forth his wand and waves it in your direction. It begins to glow with a faint blue glow. The Wizard, in a deep and resonant voice, speaks the word "Fear!" He cackles gleefully. You look at the Wizard in terror. You scramble away, trying to get as far as possible from him.  Shallow Ford You are at the southern edge of a great cavern. To the south across a shallow ford is a dark tunnel which looks like it was once enlarged and smoothed. To the north a narrow path winds among stalagmites. Dim light illuminates the cavern.
S
You have moved into a dark place. It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
LIGHT LAMP
The lamp is now on.  Dark Tunnel This is a dark tunnel with dim light to the northeast. The tunnel is smooth but dusty and filled with twigs and leaves, debris which becomes deeper as the tunnel branches into a wide corridor leading southwest and a narrower one leading southeast.
SE
North End of Garden This is the northern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls, and if you don't look up, the illusion is of a cloudy day outside. The light comes from a large growth of glowing mosses on the roof of the cave. A break in the hedge is almost overgrown to the north. A carefully manicured path leads south. In the center of a rosebed is a small open structure, painted white. It appears to be a gazebo.
ENTER GAZEBO
Gazebo This is a gazebo in the midst of a formal garden. It is cool and restful here. A tea table adorns the center of the gazebo. Sitting on the table is:    A matchbook   A china teapot   A place mat   A newspaper   A letter opener A unicorn is peacefully cropping grass at the north end of the garden. There is something hanging around its neck. Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

North End of Garden There is a beautiful unicorn here cropping grass. The unicorn bounds lightly away. Your sword is no longer glowing.
S
Formal Garden This is the middle part of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls and a dim illumination comes from mosses far above. The path is of small crushed white stones. It winds among bushes and flower beds from south to north. To the north a small structure can be seen. To the south are peculiarly shaped bushes. There is a small gap in the hedges to the west. A unicorn is peacefully cropping grass at the north end of the garden. There is something hanging around its neck. Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
W
Path Near Stream The path follows the south edge of a deep ravine and heads northeast. A tunnel heads southwest, narrowing to a rather tight crawl. A faint whirring sound can be heard in that direction. On the east is a ruined archway choked with vegetation. Your sword is no longer glowing.
SW
Carousel Room You are in a large circular room whose high ceiling is lost in gloom. Eight identical passages leave the room. A loud whirring sound comes from all around, and you feel sort of disoriented in here.
N
You're not sure which direction is which. This room is very disorienting.  Topiary This is the southern end of a formal garden. Hedges hide the cavern walls and mosses provide dim illumination. Fantastically shaped hedges and bushes are arrayed with geometric precision. They have not recently been clipped, but you can discern creatures in the shapes of the bushes: There is a dragon, a unicorn, a great serpent, a huge misshapen dog, and several human figures. On the west side of the garden the path leads through a rose arbor into a tunnel.

The hall stops abruptly to the north at a ford across a stream, where the marble is cracked and broken. Perhaps a flood or collapse of the cave was responsible. To the south the hall opens into a large room. There is rather annoying whirring sound coming from that room. There is a square brick here which feels like clay. You suddenly decide that the Wizard isn't that terrifying...
N
Deep Ford You are fording the stream at a deep but not impossible spot. The water is very cold. The walls of the ravine rise to east and west. There is a small ledge along the north wall of the ravine. To the south is the entrance to a well constructed but somewhat ruined hall.
FILL POT WITH WATER
The teapot is now full of water.
N
Ledge in Ravine You are on a narrow ledge near the bottom of a deep ravine. The ledge continues to the west. A precarious climb up to another tiny ledge is possible. A short scramble down the rock face leads to a stream.
U
Tiny Room This is a tiny room carved out of the wall of the ravine. There is an exit down a precarious climb. On the north side of the room is a massive wooden door, which has a small window barred with iron. A formidable bolt lock is set within the door frame. A keyhole covered by a thin metal lid lies within the lock.

On the south side of the room is a massive wooden door, which has a small window barred with iron. A formidable bolt lock is set within the door frame. A keyhole lies within the lock. In the center of the table sits a blue crystal sphere.

End of Ledge A ledge from the east ends here, and a tunnel leads north into the wall. There is a rather odd smokey odor in the warm air of the tunnel. Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
N
Dragon Room The room is a large cavern full of broken stone. The walls are scorched and there are deep scratches on the floor. A sooty dry smell is very strong here. A paved path winds from a large passage to the west, through the room, and across a huge stone bridge to the south. To the east a small crack is visible. A dark and smokey tunnel leads north. A huge red dragon is lying here, blocking the entrance to a tunnel leading north. Smoke curls from his nostrils and out between his teeth. Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.
HIT DRAGON WITH SWORD
That captured his interest. He stares at you balefully. The dragon continues to watch you carefully.
S
Stone Bridge This is the middle of a ruined but still impressive stone bridge spanning a deep chasm. Water flows far beneath. A paved path leads north into a large open space. To the south, the path leads into a misty tunnel. The dragon follows you, out of mingled curiosity and anger.
HIT DRAGON WITH SWORD
That captured his interest. He stares at you balefully. The dragon continues to watch you carefully.

Cool Room The room is cool and damp. The air is misty. A twisty path from the southeast splits here toward a wide northerly stone bridge, and a narrow westerly tunnel. It is from the latter that the mist and chill seem to originate. The dragon follows you, out of mingled curiosity and anger.
HIT DRAGON WITH SWORD
Dragon hide is tough as steel, but you have succeeded in annoying him a bit. He looks at you as if deciding whether or not to eat you. The dragon continues to watch you carefully.
W
Ice Room This is a large hall of ancient lava, since worn smooth by the movement of a glacier. A large passage exits to the east and an upward lava tube is at the top of a jumble of fallen rocks. A mass of ice fills the western half of the room.  As the dragon enters, he sees his reflection on the icy surface of the glacier at its western end. He becomes enraged: There is another dragon here, behind that glass, he thinks! Dragons are smart, but sometimes naive, and this one has never seen ice before. He rears up to his full height to challenge this intruder into his territory. He roars a challenge! The intruder responds! The dragon takes a deep breath, and out of his mouth pours a massive gout of flame. It washes over the ice, which melts rapidly, sending out torrents of water and a huge cloud of steam! You manage to clamber up to a small shelf, but the dragon is terrified! A huge splash goes down his throat! There is a muffled explosion and the dragon, a puzzled expression on his face, dies. He is carried away by the water.  When the flood recedes you climb gingerly down. While no trace of the dragon can be found, the melting of the ice has revealed a passage leading west. Your sword is no longer glowing.

Dragon's Lair You are in the dragon's lair, where the rock walls are scarred by flame. A blackened doorway leads to the south. A rotten old wooden chest is in one corner among the debris. A beautiful young woman, wearing a dirty and bedraggled gown, sits on a rock in the corner. Her hair is unkempt and she is oblivious to your presence, almost in a trance.
OPEN CHEST
The hinges are very rusty, but they seem to be starting to give. You can probably open it if you try again. There is something bumping around inside. All this rummaging around has startled the young woman. The princess (for she is obviously one) shakes herself awake, then notices you for the first time. She smiles. "Thank you for rescuing me from that horrid worm," she says. "I must depart. My parents will be worried about me." With that, she arises, looking purposefully out of the lair.

The rotten wooden chest opens. Nestled in the chest is a wrought gold statuette of a dragon. The princess walks south. She glances back at you as she goes.

Around its neck is a red satin ribbon on which is strung a delicate gold key. The princess takes the ribbon and uses it to tie up her hair. She looks at you and then, smiling, hands you the key and a fresh rose which she plucks from the arbor. "You may have use of such a thing," she says. "It is the least I can do for one who rescued me from a fate I dare not contemplate." With that, she mounts the unicorn (side saddle, of course) and rides off into the gloom.

Lying in the dust, and covered with mold, is a purple book.
READ WHITE BOOK
(Taken) It is written in an unfamiliar tongue and details the use of various magical objects, chiefly the so called "magic wand". Apparently these devices work by pointing them at the object to be ensorcelled, and then chanting the appropriate magic words. (It's truly amazing how credulous these ancients were, isn't it?)
DROP IT
Dropped. A strange little man in a long cloak appears suddenly in the room. He is wearing a high pointed hat embroidered with astrological signs. He has a long, stringy, and unkempt beard.

The workbench is stained from many years of use, and is deeply gouged as though some huge clawed animal was imprisoned on it. There are burn marks and even notes written in a crabbed hand. Many arcane items are scattered about the bench; alembics, mortar and pestle, small knives of various sizes, odd scraps of vellum, wax candles, and much more. In the center of a relatively clear area of the bench are affixed three stands   ruby, sapphire, and diamond   which form a triangle.

A dim shape becomes visible in the air above the sphere. The shape resolves into a large and somewhat formidable looking demon. He looks around, tests the walls of the pentagram experimentally, then sees you! "Hmm, a new master..." he says under his breath. "Greetings, oh master! Wouldst desire a service, as our contract stateth? For some pittance of wealth, some trifle, I will gratify thy desires to the utmost limit of my powers, and they are not inconsiderable." He makes a pass with his massive arms and the walls begin to shake a little. Another pass and the shaking stops. "A nice effect... I find it makes for a better relationship to give such a demonstration early on." He grins vilely.

"I hear and obey!" says the demon. He stretches out an enormous hand towards the wand. The Wizard is unsure what to do, pointing it threateningly at the demon, then at you. "Fudge!" he cries, but aside from a strong odor of chocolate in the air, there is no effect. The demon plucks the wand out of his hand (it's about toothpick size to him) and gingerly lays it before you. He fades into the smoke, which disperses. The wizard runs from the room in terror.

The creature whines happily, then the center head licks your face (which is roughly like experiencing a sandpaper washcloth).

This statement has a profound effect on portions of the crowd. You can hear rumblings from the back concerning Enchanters. The word "traitors" rises out of nowhere. Your fellow Enchanters are looking at one another nervously.

Time passes...  A tall, gruff fellow begins to speak. This is Gzornenplatz of the Guild of Huntsmen. "I'm a simple man, and I don't know much about magic. But I do know that the wild beasts are kept out of the towns and villages not just by the huntsmen, but by spells as well. Just yesterday, one of my men was attacked and badly wounded by a troop of rat ants. They'd slipped the bounds set down by a 'fripple' spell somehow. Are we going to let the sorcerers loose rat ants on us, and worse?" He sits, glaring significantly at the now angry clump of mages around you.
z
Time passes...  As the huntsman's accusations are being absorbed and discussed, Ardis of the Guild of Poets takes the floor. He begins to talk about magic rhyming and spelling aids, and their lack.  In the midst of his splendid peroration, just as he was sketching out an insulting mythological allusion in iambic hexameter, the poet turns even greener than usual. His chin elongates and his skin begins to look sort of slimy. In the blink of an eye there stands at the podium, not the orator, but rather a large orange newt. "Breek! Co ax! Co ax!" it protests.  As you look around the room in shock, you discover that Ardis is not alone. Each and every guildmaster in the room has been turned into a frog, salamander, or other amphibian! All but one, that is: yourself!  No! There is one other survivor. At the rear of the room, a shadowy figure in a dark cloak slips quietly out the door.

Guild Hall This is the entrance to the Guild Hall in Borphee. To the north is the Council Chamber, and to the south is an exit leading outside. Little is left of the sumptuous buffet lunch.

Finally, an enormous head slides into view from the east and stops with one monstrous eye staring coldly at you.

Dungeon Cell This was once a very luxurious cell, obviously for the imprisonment of a highborn or powerful person. Its rich hangings are now rotten rags; its furniture is smashed to kindling, except for one massive oak cabinet. The cell door has been blown away by an explosion, or perhaps a "rezrov" spell.

This book has been almost completely destroyed by mold and rot. You can tell only that it was once a spell book. Only one spell is still readable. It says "snavig spell: shape change."
gnusto snavig
Your spell book begins to glow softly. Slowly, ornately, the words of the snavig spell are inscribed, glowing even more brightly than the book itself. The book's brightness fades, but the spell remains! The old book in which it was written crumbles to dust as the last word is copied.

Your senses are vainly trying to find something, anything to work on. You can know your body is there, but you can't truly sense it to confirm the suspicion. Your mind is alternately drawn in three "directions" (or at least what seem like directions): east, west and south. There is something slightly different about the nothing in those directions.

Your mind starts to wander "southward," and slowly something impinges itself on your mind.  As you leave, the "9" cube reappears in your hand.  Plain This is a flat plain punctuated by boulders. The boulders are all identical and slide to and fro on the eerie surface, propelled by an unknown mechanism. The ground is scratched by many intersecting lines which seem to have a regular pattern. From where you are standing you can see lines radiating north, east, west and south. There is a large green eyed rock here. Also, there is a large brown eyed rock with a featureless white cube on its back some distance to the east. Far in the distance are mountains which quiver itchily as they belch forth purple fire.

Directly in front of you, a horrific creature recoils with a look of shocked surprise. It scuttles off, perplexed.  Grue Cave A natural amphitheater carved out of the underground rock opens from several small passages. The cave is crowded with grues of all shapes and sizes. At the lowest point of the cave a small pool of light has gathered, glowing very dimly (from a human point of view). The grues avoid it, and in fact it hurts your eyes to look at it for very long. In the middle of the pool is a short, squat pillar with something on top of it. This is the object of all the attention. The grues seem to regard the pillar or its contents with awe.

The appointments are simple, the fare is unsophisticated, but those here have a look of quiet contentment that is easy for you to envy. Belboz is meditating here.

Belboz looks at you suspiciously. "You were here a few days ago, or rather someone who resembled you strongly enough to be your twin was here. This being betrayed its true nature, however, as it did not know facts which would be trifles to even the rawest apprentice. It fled before I could capture it. Prove to me that you are truly yourself, and answer me a question. Of the necromancers, who other than (harumph) myself is best known?"

Belboz looks at the cube for a while, turning it over and over in his hands. "There is a legend about cubes. When the foundations of the world were laid down, it is said that the elemental powers and forces were symbolized during the making by small cubes. The cubes and the forces were merged in a way that our knowledge no longer comprehends. When the making was done, the cubes were hidden away where their powers could not be tampered with. If someone has gained access to them, or rediscovered the knowledge of their making, we are in terrible danger. One who had power over these cubes could change the very structure of our universe. Such a one would have powers I do not care to contemplate." Belboz gives back the cube.

Abruptly, your surroundings shift.  Sand Room A thin trickle of sand flows down from an exit in the ceiling of this circular room to a pile of sand on the floor. The walls of the room are glass, but you can see nothing through them. In the sand is a hole through which, oddly enough, no sand is pouring out.

As you leave, the "x10" cube reappears in your hand.  Dungeon Cell This is a luxurious cell, obviously for the imprisonment of a highborn or powerful person. Its rich hangings and heavily ornamented furniture speak of a prisoner whose comfort is important even during imprisonment. A massive oak cabinet dominates one wall. The massive cabinet is closed.

As you leave, the "x10" cube reappears in your hand.  Ruins Room This is the south end of a vast chamber filled with partially ruined structures. Here the portico of a building is collapsing. The pillars holding it up are starting to crumble. One has recently fallen and smashed the pavement. The fall exposed and the rubble blocked a small channel filled with swiftly rushing water which is rapidly inundating the area. You are in a small area not yet flooded. There is a sack here.

Abruptly, your surroundings shift.  Magic Room This place is odd indeed. Nothing that you look at is what it seems. If you look at something carefully enough it turns out to be something entirely different. The room is cluttered with objects and obviously hasn't been cleaned in a long time. The floor is overgrown with grass and weeds, and rabbits have chewed them. There are bird nests around the ceiling and droppings here and there. A very untidy and unsettling place. Much of the walls, ceiling and floor is covered in mirrors. There are empty, mirrorless square areas at north and south and a round black emptiness to the east.
e
As you leave, the "12" cube reappears in your hand.  Mocking laughter echoes around you.  Castle This is the audience chamber. It is high and spacious, and every proportion and decoration is intended to highlight the throne that looms before you. The throne itself is bathed in light, but only featureless gray may be seen through the windows and skylights.
z
Time passes...  Around the throne a dark mist begins to coalesce. It thickens into the outline of a human figure sitting nonchalantly on the throne. You can see the ghost of a cloak and hood as well.
z
Time passes...  The figure speaks. "It's been such a pleasure to follow your progress. Thank you for collecting the cubes."
z
Time passes...  The figure waves its arms in the air. Before you, rolling and tumbling in a bath of light, are four cubes. "When I gathered these and the "1" cube, after searching old tomes and questioning the wise about their whereabouts, I conceived my plan. I could not gather the remainder of the cubes, but to achieve my desire, they had to be brought together. Who better than you to act in my stead?"
take knife
The shadow notices you. "You force me to take precautions." The shadow gestures, and you are frozen in place, unable to move even your littlest finger.  "It was a simple matter to perturb the cubes I had to make your simple magics flicker or fail. I knew this would set you on a quest. For I know you well!" The four cubes disappear. The figure sits straight on its throne and removes its hood. You are looking at a shadowy, dark and transparent version of yourself!  "Magic is a powerful force, the most powerful in the universe, but its exercise has its price. Each time a great mage performs a spell, some part of the power in that spell is lost in shadow. A great mage ultimately creates a shadow self that is dimly aware." The figure grins. "You have become the most powerful wizard of all, for I, your shadow, have become very nearly as powerful as you!"
z
Time passes...  "But why, you ask, am I collecting the elemental cubes? It's easy to answer. I am not powerful enough. My existence is still but a shadow of your own. My desires are unfulfilled. I wish power over all creation! I wish to remold the universe in my own image, and rule it. In such a universe, my merest whim would smash a star or slay a butterfly. You have brought me the tools of the remaking!"  The shadowy figure deftly takes the "1" cube from the sack and sets it in the air between you, where it hangs motionless.  Your little finger is full of pins and needles. You could move it if you wanted.
z
Time passes...  The shadowy figure deftly takes the "5" cube from the sack and places it next to the "1" cube. They disappear into a glowing line which appears between them. The shadowy figure places the "11" cube and the "3" cube in the air, creating a square of glowing light.  Your feet and hands feel as if they've been asleep, but you can move them.
z
Time passes...  Four more cubes are placed above the square: the "2" cube, the "6" cube, the "8" cube and the "10" cube. A cube of light shimmers before you. The shadow is growing more excited, hopping around the structure to place the cubes.  Your arms and legs are free, but you still cannot speak or move your head.
z
Time passes...  All the remaining cubes save one, the "12" cube, build another square, then the shadow adds its own four cubes to make a second cube of light, which hangs next to the first.  You feel almost thawed, but your mouth feels full of cotton.
z
Time passes...  The shadow grabs the first cube of light, and twisting, chanting, squeezing, the cube is compressed and thrust inside the second cube. The points of the inner and outer cube connect, and it begins to tumble, seeming to twist and distort as one face, then another, presents itself to you. The figure capers madly in front of its construction, laughing and giggling. It ignores you.  The freeze has worn entirely off! Your contact with the "12" cube must have weakened it.
z
Time passes...  The shadowy figure deftly takes the "12" cube from you and raising it high, thrusts it into the center of the tesseract! Cascades of light pour forth, blindingly bright, but you can still see the "12" cube at the center. The shadow is growing more solid, no longer transparent and dark! Chortling gleefully, it prepares to jump into the hypercube!
cast girgol
As you cast the spell, the vellum scroll vanishes! The shadow freezes in mid leap! You can tell the spell won't hold for long in this magically charged atmosphere! You are beginning to tire.
take 12
You tug and pull at the cube, trying desperately to remove it from its place in the center of the tesseract. With your last reserve of strength you free it!
put sack in tesseract
You push the sack into the hypercube, where it hangs unsupported.  Time resumes its forward flight.

<RRROWWGRROWL> Your stomach growls.  You've been vegging out in front of that flickering screen for hours, your pet by your side. Now your complaining stomach sets you up on your feet, and on a mission.  Snack Time! An Interactive Break for a Bite by Hardy the Bulldog (with help from Renee Choba) Release 1 / Serial number 080929 / Inform 7 build 5U92 (I6/v6.31 lib 6/12N)  (For more information please type ABOUT)  Sitting Room This is the room where you sit a lot. Well, you sleep here sometimes too. But there is a different room that is just for sleeping, and it is to the north. There's another room to the west. It's the room with the food. That is a good room.  Even though this is the sitting room you can't sit on everything. There are a lot of "no"s here, like the thing you can't scratch, and the tall thing and the four legged thing that isn't alive but that stands still with the box of light on its back.  Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.
w
Food Room Food room, glorious food room!  Your bowl for food and water is here, but that's only the beginning. There's also a lot of secret places where your pet keeps food and things that go with food and things that make food better. There's a thing that gets hot and a box that stays cold, and that is your favorite because you know there is always food inside there. A cloth hangs down from the door of the cold box.
pull cloth
This is a good trick!  You pull on the cloth with your teeth and back up as the door opens. Inside you can see various leftovers, some jars, some sandwich fixings and one shiny can.
close cold box
You push the door with your nose and close the cold box.
e
Sitting Room Your pet is here, all stretched out on the long soft thing and snoring.
push pet
You tuck your head up under your pet and push back and forth to shake him.  Your pet twitches a little and stirs, then is still again. It's a start at waking him up.
bark
You try a few short, sharp barks.  Your pet gets one eye open and half heartedly pets at you. You're making progress.
lick pet
You love on your pet with some little licks.  Your pet shifts and stretches, blinking. He moves around until he is mostly sitting up.  "Hey Hardy," he mumbles.  It might take a little more to get him up and moving, but at least now his eyes are open!  [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]
x box
Sometimes the box sleeps but a lot of the time it is loud and noisy and bright. Sometimes you've seen things like the outside inside it or yummy looking food or even little dogs in there. But everything is the wrong size and doesn't smell right, so you're not sure what that's about.  Right now it looks like some little people inside are yapping at each other.
x couch
On the long soft thing are a bunch of smaller soft things that together make up a comfy place for sitting or sleeping.
x soft things
These smaller soft things make up the long soft thing. Sometimes they must get hungry because they try to eat things that get left on the long soft thing. Sometimes they get separated from the long soft thing. But mostly they just all hang out together. They must be friends.
take cushion
You tug and pull at the little soft things until finally one breaks free from the bunch. As you dislodge it, something clatters to the floor. Ah ha! You've found the magic wand! Those little soft things were trying to eat it!  "So that's where that got away to," says your pet, snatching up the magic wand. He points it at the box of light and makes it even louder.

Your pet smiles as he reaches for the can. "Good boy, Hardy," he says, scratching you behind the ears. Your tail starts wagging; you just can't help it. (You've always been a fool for a good behind the ears scratch.)  The can hisses with releasing air as the top pops, and then your pets takes a few good gulps. He must have been really thirsty, because soon he stands up and walks off to the other room.  From the other room, you hear your pet banging around and yelling about the dino. Your pet must have almost tripped on it. He's always almost tripping on little stuff like that.  After a second, you hear a click as the door to the water room closes. Now you have the long soft thing all to yourself!  [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]
get on couch
You climb up unto the long soft thing, happy that it is low enough for you to get on all by yourself.  On the long soft thing are a bunch of smaller soft things that together make up a comfy place for sitting or sleeping. The magic wand is hanging out here too, even though it got eaten by the little soft things before. No hard feelings.

push wand
Making sure you are facing the box of light, you carefully press down on the wand with your teeth and are delighted when the box of light flickers and changes!   Now you see a bunch of tiny people running around chasing a little bitty ball. Uh oh, someone got pushed. Ugh, the faces got all huge, and they don't look happy.
push wand
Once again you chomp down to change what's inside the box. This time there are these guys poking at each other, kinda fighting and joking around and all.   This is the sort of thing your pet seems to enjoy watching sometimes, people getting hit with food and slipping and falling down and stuff. Everybody is laughing and nobody ever seems to really get hurt, so you guess it's OK.
push wand
You've got the hang of this trick now for sure! One more bite on the wand brings up something new.  This is more like it! Inside the box now is this lady putting together some tasty looking food! You're almost drooling just watching. This has got to make your pet think about eating!  [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.  You finally hear a familiar rush of water from the little water room and, after a second, the sound of the door opening.
z
You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.  From the other room, you hear your pet banging around and yelling about the dino. Your pet must have almost tripped on it. He's always almost tripping on little stuff like that.  Your pet walks in. He starts to sit down on the long soft thing but stops when he sees what's in the box of light. That lady cooking is doing her job! You pet stands and watches, transfixed. He must be thinking of food!
z
You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.  Your pet makes his way to the food room.  Your pet starts rattling around in the food room. Yes! He must be making a snack!
n
Sleeping Room Most of the time when you are in here it is dark and quiet because that is the best way to sleep and this is the room made for sleeping. There is a high bed here that is not your bed although it is where you sleep usually to keep your pet company. The sitting room is south of here and the room with the water is to the west.  Your low bed is here, looking all soft and cushy.  Dino is here!  From the other room you can hear the happy sound of the cold box being opened.
take dino
(As you open your mouth, you drop the magic wand.)  You snatch up the dino with your mouth and hold on tight.  From the other room you can hear the sound of secret places opening and closing.
s
Sitting Room You don't hear anything from the food room. But then, making a sandwich is not a very noisy job.
w
Food Room Your pet is here, working on making a snack.  You can also see a square soft thing here.  One by one, your pet starts pulling the sandwich fixings out of the cold box and turning them into a sandwich.
drop dino
You know, leaving the dino here puts it in just the right spot for tripping your pet when he tries to walk out with the sandwich. What a great trick!  Your pet starts putting stuff away and soon closes the cold box. You're sure that in just a minute he will be taking the sandwich out to the sitting room to eat it.
z
You pause for a second. Your stomach growls.  Your pet seems to have finished cleaning up after making the snack. He turns to leave. Now is the moment of truth.

ZORK III: The Dungeon Master Copyright 1982 by Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved. ZORK is a trademark of Infocom, Inc. Release 17 / Serial number 840727  Endless Stair You are at the bottom of a seemingly endless stair, winding its way upward beyond your vision. An eerie light, coming from all around you, casts strange shadows on the walls. To the south is a dark and winding trail. Your old friend, the brass lantern, is at your feet.
GET LAMP
Taken.
S
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
LIGHT LAMP
The lamp is now on.  Junction You are at the junction of a north south passage and an east west passage. To the north, you can make out the bottom of a stairway. The ways to the east and south are relatively cramped, but a wider trail leads to the west. Standing before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.
W
Barren Area You are west of the junction, where the rock bound passage widens out into a large, flat area. Although the land here is barren, you can see vegetation to the west. South of here is a mighty wall of stone, ancient and crumbling.  To the southwest the wall has decayed enough to form an opening, through which seeps a thin mist. A trail dips sharply into rocky terrain to the northwest.
W
Cliff This is a remarkable spot in the dungeon. Perhaps two hundred feet above you is a gaping hole in the earth's surface through which pours bright sunshine! A few seedlings from the world above, nurtured by the sunlight and occasional rains, have grown into giant trees, making this a virtual oasis in the desert of the Underground Empire. To the west is a sheer precipice, dropping nearly fifty feet to jagged rocks below. The way south is barred by a forbidding stone wall, crumbling from age. There is a jagged opening in the wall to the southwest, through which leaks a fine mist. The land to the east looks lifeless and barren. A rope is tied to one of the large trees here and is dangling over the side of the cliff, reaching down to the shelf below. It seems as if somebody has been here recently, as there is some fresh bread lying beneath one of the other trees.
GET BREAD

Junction Standing before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.
E
Damp Passage This is a particularly damp spot even by dungeon standards. You can see a crossroads to the west, and two nearly identical passages lead east and northeast. A stone channel, wide and deep, steeply descends into the room from the south. It is covered with moss and lichen, and is far too slippery to climb. The channel crosses the room, but the opening where it once continued north is now blocked by rubble.
NE
Engravings Room You are in a room with passages heading southwest and southeast. The north wall is ornately carved, filled with strange runes and writing in an unfamiliar language.
SE
Dead End You have come to the end of two adjoining passages to the west and the northwest.
W
Damp Passage
NE
Engravings Room An old and wizened man is huddled, asleep, in the corner. He is snoring loudly. From his appearance, he is weak and frail.
WAKE UP OLD MAN
The old man is roused to consciousness. He peers at you through eyes which appear much younger and stronger than his frail body and waits, as if expecting something to happen.
GIVE BREAD TO OLD MAN
He looks up at you and takes the waybread from you. Slowly, he eats the bread and pauses when he is finished. He starts to speak: "Perhaps what you seek is through there!" He points at the carved wall to the north, where you now notice the bare outline of a secret door. When you turn back to the old man, you notice that he has gone!
SW

W
Junction Standing before you is a great rock. Imbedded within it is an Elvish sword.
S
Creepy Crawl You are in a dark and quite creepy crawlway with passages leaving to the north, east, south, and southwest.
S
Foggy Room You are in a dank passage filled with a wispy fog. A spooky passageway leads north and a wider path heads off to the south. To the west, the path leaves the rock and enters an eerie, shadowy land.
S
Lake Shore You are in a wide cavern on the north shore of a small lake. Some polished stone steps lead to the southeast and a sheer rock face prevents any movement around the lake to the southwest. The cavern is dimly lit from above.
TURN OFF LAMP
The lamp is now off.
DROP LAMP
Dropped.
JUMP LAKE
You are nearly paralyzed by the icy waters as you swim into the center of the lake.  On the Lake You are floating on the surface of the lake. The water is ice cold and your ability to survive here for long is very questionable. A swim north puts you at your starting point. Conditions to the east are poor where the lake turns into swamp. The west and south shores are suitable for walking, however.
D
Underwater You are below the surface of the lake. It turns out that the lake is quite shallow and the bottom is only a few feet below you. Considering the frigid temperature of the water, you should probably not plan an extended stay.  The lake bottom is sandy and a few hearty plants and algae live there. Out of the corner of your eye, a small, shiny object appears in the sand. A moment later, it is gone!
GET AMULET
The shiny object slips from your grasp and back onto the floor of the lake, where it is covered in sand. You catch a brief glimpse of something shiny in the sand.
GET AMULET
You reach the shiny object. It is a simple golden amulet! The icy waters are taking their toll. You will not be able to hold out much longer. You run out of air and return to the surface. On the Lake
W
Western Shore You are on the western shore of the lake. The ground here is quite hard, but a few sickly reeds manage to grow near the water's edge. The only path leads into the rock to the south.
S
Scenic Vista You are in a small chamber carved in the rock, with the sole exit to the north. Mounted on one wall is a table labelled "Scenic Vista," whose featureless surface is angled toward you. One might believe that the table was used to indicate points of interest in the view from this spot, like those found in many parks. On the other hand, your surroundings are far from spacious and by no stretch of the imagination could this spot be considered scenic. An indicator above the table reads "III". Mounted on one wall is a flaming torch, which fills the room with a flickering light. The indicator above the table flickers briefly, then changes to "IV".

The only apparent exit, to the east, seems to be a blur and a loud, whirring sound resounds through the rock. A spray can is in the corner. In large type is the legend "Frobozz Magic Grue Repellent."

S
Southern Shore You are on the south shore of the lake. Rock formations prevent movement to the west and thickening swamp to the east makes the going all but impossible. To the south, where the beach meets a rock formation, you can make out a dark passage sloping steeply upward into the rock.
S
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
SPRAY REPELLANT ON MYSELF
The spray smells like a mixture of old socks and burning rubber. If I were a grue I'd sure stay clear!
S
There are sinister gurgling noises in the darkness all around you! It is pitch black. The ground continues to slope upwards away from the lake. You can barely  detect a dim light from the east.
E
Key Room You are between some rock and a dark place, The room is lit dimly from above, revealing a lone, dark path sloping down to the west. To one side of the room is a large manhole cover. The light from above seems to be focused in the center of the room, where a single key is lying in the dust.
GET KEY
Taken.
MOVE COVER
The cover is moved a bit to one side, revealing a small hole leading into darkness. That horrible smell is much less pungent now.
D
Aqueduct You are in a wide stone channel, part of the water supply system for the Great Underground Empire. The source of water was a waterfall to the south, which has long since dried up. Water flowed along the aqueduct to the north. This region is lit from above, although the source of light is not apparent.
N
High Arch You are now on one of the tallest arches of the aqueduct, hundreds of feet above a rocky chasm. The immensity of the aqueduct project is apparent from here. Stone supports rise from the rock floor to form massive arches, which traverse the region from north to south. The water carrying channel here is wide and deep. To the west and far below, you can make out a balcony which must command a wide view of the aqueduct.
N
Water Slide You are near the northern end of this segment of the aqueduct system. To the south and slightly uphill, the bulk of the aqueduct looms ominously, towering above a gorge. To the north, the water channel drops precipitously and enters a rocky hole. The damp moss and lichen would certainly make that a one way trip.

Cliff Ledge This is a rock strewn ledge near the base of a tall cliff. The bottom of the cliff is another fifteen feet below. You have little hope of climbing up the cliff face, but you might be able to scramble down from here (though it's doubtful you could return). A long piece of rope is dangling down from the top of the cliff and is within your reach. A large chest, closed and locked, is lying among the boulders.

WAIT
Time passes... At the edge of the cliff above you, a man appears. He looks down at you and speaks. "Hello, down there! You seem to have a problem. Maybe I can help you." He chuckles in an unsettling sort of way. "Perhaps if you tied that chest to the end of the rope I might be able to drag it up for you.  Then, I'll be more than happy to help you up!"  He laughs again.
TIE CHEST TO ROPE
The chest is now tied to the rope. The man above you looks pleased. "Now there's a good friend! Thank you very much, indeed!" He pulls on the rope and the chest is lifted to the top of the cliff and out of sight. With a short laugh, he disappears. "I'll be back in a short while!" are his last words.

You grab securely on to the rope. The man starts to heave on the rope and within a few moments you arrive at the top of the cliff. The man removes the last few valuables from the chest and prepares to leave. "You've been a good sport! Here, take this, for whatever good it is! I can't see that I'll be needing one!" He hands you a plain wooden staff from the bottom of the chest and begins examining his valuables. The chest, open and empty, is at your feet.

Flathead Ocean You are at the shore of an amazing underground sea, the topic of many a legend among adventurers. Few were known to have arrived at this spot, and fewer to return. There is a heavy surf and a breeze is blowing on shore. The land rises steeply to the east and quicksand prevents movement to the south. A thick mist covers the ocean and extends over the hills to the east.  A path heads north along the beach.

Time passes... Through the shadows, a cloaked and hooded figure appears before you, blocking the northeastern exit from the room and carrying a brightly glowing sword. From nowhere, the sword from the junction appears in your hand, wildly glowing!
KILL FIGURE WITH SWORD
A quick stroke catches the hooded figure off guard! Blood trickles down the figure's arm! The figure has a light wound which hasn't affected its seemingly great strength. You dodge as the hooded figure comes in low.
KILL FIGURE WITH SWORD
Your move was not quick enough and misses the mark. The hooded figure stabs nonchalantly with its sword and misses.
KILL FIGURE WITH SWORD
A quick stroke, but the hooded figure is on guard. You are wounded by a lightning thrust!
KILL FIGURE WITH SWORD
The hooded figure is hit with a quick slash! The figure has some wounds and is probably not capable of hindering your movement. You dodge as the hooded figure comes in low.
KILL FIGURE WITH SWORD
A good parry! Your sword wounds the hooded figure! The figure is hurt, and its strength appears to be fading. The hooded figure attempts a thrust, but its weakened state prevents hitting you.
KILL FIGURE WITH SWORD
The hooded figure is hit with a quick slash! The figure appears to be badly hurt and defenseless. The hooded figure attempts a thrust, but its weakened state prevents hitting you.
REMOVE HOOD
You slowly remove the hood from your badly wounded opponent and recoil in horror at the sight of your own face, weary and wounded. A faint smile comes to the lips and then the face starts to change, very slowly, into that of an old, wizened person. The image fades and with it the body of your hooded opponent. The cloak remains on the ground.

Dropped.

Crystal Grotto This is a chamber of breathtaking beauty. Mighty stalagmites form structured shapes of rock, encrusted with crystalline formations. Phosphorescent mosses, fed by a trickle of water from some unseen source above, make the crystals glow and sparkle with every color of the rainbow. There is an opening to the west, and a man made passage heads south.

Great Door This is the south end of a monumental hall, full of dust and debris from a recent earthquake. To the east is a great iron door, rusted shut. To its right, however, is a gaping cleft in the rock and behind, a cleared area.
E
Museum Entrance This is the entrance to the Royal Museum, the finest and grandest in the Great Underground Empire. To the south, down a few steps, is the entrance to the Royal Puzzle and to the east, through a stone door, is the Royal Jewel Collection. A wooden door to the north is open and leads to the Museum of Technology. To the west is a great iron door, rusted shut. To its left, however, is a cleft in the rock providing a western route away from the museum.
N
Technology Museum This is a large hall which hosted the technological exhibits of the Great Underground Empire. A door to the south is open. Directly in front of you is a large golden machine, which has a seat with a console in front. On the console is a single button and a dial connected to a three digit display which reads 948. The machine is suprisingly shiny and shows few signs of age. A strange grey machine, shaped somewhat like a clothes dryer, is on one side of the room. On the other side of the hall is a powerful looking black machine, a tight tangle of wires, pipes, and motors. A plaque is mounted near the door. The writing is faded, however, and cannot be made out clearly. The two machines seem to be in bad shape, rusting in many spots.

On the other side of the hall is a powerful looking black machine, a tight tangle of wires, pipes, and motors. A plaque is mounted near the door. The grey machine, it turns out, is a Frobozz Magic Pressurizer, used in the coal mines of the Empire. The black machine is a Frobozz Magic Room Spinner. The golden machine is referred to as a Temporizer. All are non working models donated by Frobozzco president John D. Flathead. Directly in front of you is a large golden machine, which has a seat with a console in front. On the console is a single button and a dial connected to a three digit display which reads 776.

Hallway This is a part of the long hallway. The east and west walls are dressed stone. In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel. In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around which is engraved a compass rose. The hallway continues to the south. A large mirror fills the north side of the hallway. The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
N
Inside Mirror You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather complicated. Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor is open.  As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of carved and polished wood are to your left and right. The left panel is mahogany, the right pine. The wall you face is red on its left half and black on its right. On the entrance side, the wall is white opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the black section. The painted walls are at least twice the length of the unpainted ones. The ceiling is painted blue.  In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot deep. The channel is oriented in a north south direction. In the exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular depression perhaps two feet wide. Incised in the stone around this area is a compass rose.  Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled. This bar is pierced in two places. The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus the center of the room). The second is at the left end of the room (as you face opposite the entrance). Through each hole runs a wooden pole.  The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip. The pole has been dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.  The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel. This bottom end of the pole has a T bar a bit less than two feet long attached to it, and on the T bar is carved an arrow. The arrow and T bar are pointing west.

As you leave, the door swings shut. Hallway This is a part of the long hallway. The east and west walls are dressed stone. In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel. In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around which is engraved a compass rose. Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor. The statues represent Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage. They are portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped around formidable bludgeons. The south side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small hallways to the southeast and southwest.
OPEN VIAL
The vial is open. There is a sweet odor from within the vial, apparently coming from a heavy but invisible liquid.
DRINK LIQUID
You "drink" the contents in one gulp, but nothing unusual seems to have happened as a result.
N
Hallway This is a part of the long hallway. The east and west walls are dressed stone. In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel. In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around which is engraved a compass rose. On either side of you are identical stone statues holding bludgeons. They appear ready to strike, though, for the moment, they remain impassive. The corridor continues north and south.

N
Dungeon Entrance You are in a north south hallway which ends, to the north, at a large wooden door. The corridor continues south. The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height. The door itself is closed.
KNOCK ON DOOR
The knock reverberates along the hall. For a time it seems there will be no answer. Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden panel. Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an old man appears. After a moment, he starts to smile broadly. He disappears for an instant and the massive door opens without a sound. The old man motions and you feel yourself drawn toward him. "I am the Master of the Dungeon!" he booms. "I have been watching you closely during your journey through the Great Underground Empire. Yes!," he says, as if recalling some almost forgotten time, "we have met before, although I may not appear as I did then."  You look closely into his deeply lined face and see the faces of the old man by the secret door, your "friend" at the cliff, and the hooded figure. "You have shown kindness to the old man, and compassion toward the hooded one. I have seen you display patience in the puzzle and trust at the cliff. You have demonstrated strength, ingenuity, and valor. However, one final test awaits you. Now!  Command me as you will, and complete your quest!"  Narrow Corridor You are in a narrow north south corridor. At the south end is a door and at the north end is an east west corridor. The door is closed. The dungeon master is quietly leaning on his staff here.
N
South Corridor You are in an east west corridor which turns north at its eastern and western ends. The walls are made of the finest marble. An additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor. The dungeon master follows you.
E
East Corridor This is a hall with polished marble walls. It widens slightly as it turns west at its northern and southern ends. The dungeon master follows you.
N
North Corridor This is a wide east west corridor which opens onto a northern parapet at its center. You can see flames and smoke as you peer towards the parapet. The corridor turns south at either end, and in the center of the south wall is a heavy wooden door with a small window barred with iron. The door is closed. The dungeon master follows you.
N
Parapet You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large parapet overlooking a fiery pit. It is difficult to see through the smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less bottomless. The pit itself is circular, about two hundred feet in diameter, and is fashioned of roughly hewn stone. The flames generate considerable heat, so it is rather uncomfortable standing here. There is an object here which looks like a sundial. On it are an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button. On the face of the dial are numbers 1 through 8. The indicator points to the number 1. To the south, across a narrow corridor, is a prison cell. The dungeon master follows you.
READ BOOK
The book seems to will itself open to a specific page. On it is a picture of eight small rooms located around a great circle of flame. All are identical save one, which has a bronze door leading to a magnificent room bathed in golden light. A legend beneath the picture says only "The Dungeon and Treasury of Zork."

Prison Cell You are in a featureless prison cell. You can see an east west corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you. Your view also takes in the parapet, and behind, a large, fiery pit. The dungeon master is standing on the parapet, leaning on his wooden staff. His keen gaze is fixed on you and he looks somewhat tense, as if waiting for something to happen. Behind you, to the south, is a bronze door which is closed.
DUNGEON MASTER, TURN DIAL TO 8 AND PRESS BUTTON
"If you wish," he replies. "If you wish," he replies. Prison Cell You are in a bare prison cell. Its wooden door is securely fastened, and you can see only flames and smoke through its small window. On the south wall is a bronze door which seems to be closed. You notice that the cell door is now closed.
UNLOCK BRONZE DOOR WITH KEY
The key seems to mold itself to the shape of the lock. With a mere twist of your hand, the massive bolt gives way.
OPEN IT
On the other side of the bronze door is a narrow passage which opens out into a larger area.

(Do not use with Gargoyle due to bugs.)  Man, what a party! That was a night to remember   actually it'll be a miracle if I remember it at all tomorrow!  Oh, by the way, I'm Goldilocks. I'm a nineteen year old blonde bombshell and I'm on my way back from yet another crazy art school party. It's about five AM and the sun's already up, as are the birds, who are doing their level best to aggravate my hangover with their bloody singing! I could really use something to eat and somewhere to sleep off this hangover, but something tells me I shouldn't have taken this shortcut through the forest. I have a really baaad feeling about it... Goldilocks is a FOX! Copyright (c) 16 Sep 2002 by J. J. Guest Release 1 / Serial number 090410 / Inform v6.31 Library 6/11 S  In the enchanted forest A large wooden sign informs me that I'm in the Enchanted Forest. What it doesn't tell me is how the hell I get out! Everywhere I look there are trees, trees, trees. This place definately has a 'tree' theme going. A clearly marked path leads south and west, whilst in every other direction are, well, trees. An old pedlar is sitting on a log here, tending to his bunions.
examine pedlar
He looks distictly shifty   he'd look more at home on a market stall in Hackney Wick than wandering around an enchanted forest. The pedlar is carrying a battered suitcase.
ask pedlar about suitcase
'Magic Beans, love. Only the very best   imported from darkest Peru. Only one cow a packet!'
ask pedlar about beans
'That's right love, magic, they are. Not your ordinary beans, these.'
south
On a path in the forest I'm on a path winding through the Enchanted Forest. The path winds its way from the north towards the west. In every other direction there are dark, sinister looking trees that wave their branches at me in an anthropomorphic kind of way. Ooh, I'm soooo scared!
west
As I head off along the path a pathetic, mangey looking wolf jumps out from behind a bush and slobbers at me in what he probably hopes is a menacing way.    'I am the Big Bad Wolf!' says he. Then, after an awkward pause he adds 'well, what are you waiting for? Aren't you going to ask me the way to Grandma's house?' He looks at me quizzically for a moment and then slaps his forehead.    'My humblest apologies!' he says. 'You are not the young woman I seek. She of the crimson shawl must needs be elsewhere!' He darts back into the forest.   At a fork in the path I'm at a fork in the path. Not the kind of fork you eat with, the sort where the path forks; you know, like a fork. To the north the path widens into a clearing. To the west it disappears into the forest.
north
In a clearing in the forest I'm in a clearing. There is a teeny tiny cottage here complete with a thatched roof and leaded windows. It's just like something out of a fairy tale, funnily enough, except for the large hand painted sign designed to deter trespassers. Just to the north is the front porch. A little path lined by rows of white painted stones leads around the side of the house to the west.
north
On the porch I'm standing on the porch of the Three Bears' cottage. It would be quite pretty in a rustic sort of way had someone not seen fit to paint it gold. The front door is closed.  Just south of me is the clearing in the forest. A battered old dustbin sits to one side of the porch.  I can also see a milkbottle (in which is a crumpled note) here.

west
In the garden I'm in a little garden alongside the cottage. There's a vegetable plot in a sunny spot by the wall and on the other side of the garden a somewhat neglected ornamental pond. There's obviously been some attempt at landscaping but the effect is less Capability Brown and more incapable bruin. A ramshackle potting shed completes the image of horticultural incompetence. To the north, an overgrown pergola leads into a meadow.
examine vegetable plot
It's in a sunny spot by the side of the cottage. There's a bunch of leaves sticking out of the ground there; weird! Also in the plot is an overripe pumpkin.
pull leaves
I take hold of the leaves and give them a good yank. Something pops out of the ground in a great shower of earth! There seems to be some kinda root vegetable actually attached to the leaves. Weird; I always thought these things came from tins!  [My score has just gone up by three points.]

north
In a small meadow I'm in a small meadow at the back of the cottage, separated from the forest by a rickety fence. In the middle of the meadow is what appears to be a homemade wind turbine! To the south, through the tangled pergola, is the garden. Daisy the cow is standing here, chewing disinterestedly on a mouthful of hay.
feed turnip to daisy
Daisy gobbles down the turnip excitedly before sidling over to me and nuzzling my chest. I get impression she thinks I've got more turnips hidden somewhere about my person. I can't imagine where she gets that idea.  [My score has just gone up by three points.]

'Ah, now there's a lovely specimen!' says the Pedlar, getting up from his log and feeling Daisy's knees. He seems satisfied. 'all present and correct! Here you go love   you'll be cured in no time!' He opens his suitcase and hands me a small packet, then leads Daisy off into the forest.  [My score has just gone up by three points.]

In the potting shed I'm in the potting shed, a ramshackle structure that was obviously cobbled together in five minutes some idle Sunday afternoon.  I didn't know bears had green fingers. In fact I didn't know they had fingers at all. Plant pots of all sizes are scattered about the shed untidily and the whole place is festooned with cobwebs. In the corner is an old metal trunk marked 'FISHING TACKLE.'  I can also see a pair of secateurs and a ratty old paintbrush here.

The plant pots are piled precariously against the wall of the shed.

(emptying the milkbottle first) Okay, I filled the bottle with water from the pond. Yeeurrggh! My hand is covered in pondslime now! Thanks a lot!
water bean
Okay, I watered the magic bean. After a few moments there is a low rumble from underground. The ground begins to shake violently...     Aaah! Something shot out of the ground and knocked me flying! I'm lying spreadeagled on the ground beneath this MASSIVE beanstalk! Well, I say massive, actually it stops abruptly just above the roof of the cottage.  Damn, I seem to have dropped all my stuff...   [My score has just gone up by three points.]

climb beanstalk
If Jack can do it, so can Goldilocks! At the top of the beanstalk I'm at the top of the beanstalk. I was under the impression that these giant beanstalks all had castles at the top of them, but not this scrawny specimen. However I can almost touch the roof of the cottage from here.
jump to roof
Okay... Oof! Fortunately for you I had a soft landing on the thatched roof of the cottage... On the roof I'm perched precariously on the roof of the cottage, trying desperately not to look down. There is a chimney here attached to which is a TV aerial. It kind of spoils the chocolate box look of the place if you know what I mean. The top of the beanstalk can be seen poking up above the roofline.
climb down chimney
Okay here goes... Wheee! I slid right down the chimney and out of the fireplace! That was fun. Can I do it again? In the kitchen I am in the bears' tiny kitchen, a cosy little room that could have come straight from the pages of Country Living. It's big on original features and totally lacking in "mod cons." A large dining table sits in the centre of the room and there is a dresser against the wall. Opposite the dresser is an enormous brick fireplace that seems to fill half the room.  On the dining table are a spoon, a large bowl of hot porridge, a medium sized bowl of cold porridge and a tiny little bowl of just right porridge.
north
In the pantry I'm in the pantry, a small claustrophobic room which smells faintly of cinammon, honey and the mouse droppings that are liberally sprinkled across the tiled floor. There is an upright freezer in the corner and some sturdy shelves stacked high with box after box of McScottie's porridge oats. The kitchen lies to the south.  On the shelf is a matchbox.  Over in the corner of the pantry, underneath the shelves is a mousetrap.
examine mousetrap
A simple little gadget designed to deliver swift and painless death to harmless little rodents. There's a dead mouse in it right now. He seems to have been lured there by a large wedge of cheese.

east
In the hall My first impression upon entering the entrance hall of the Three Bears' cottage is of hundreds of eyes staring glassily down at me from every corner. Virtually every forest creature from the tiniest shrew to the largest moose is represented in a macabre collection of hunting trophies. And not just forest creatures either; I'd swear that some of these heads are human! On one wall is a full length portrait of the bear clan. A narrow staircase leads upwards, and there are doors to the north and west. Completing the morbid ambiance is a motheaten bearskin rug.   'Ding Dong!' The doorbell rings. A booming voice can be heard from the direction of the front door: 'Little pigs, little pigs, LET ME IN, or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!'
open door
I open the door a tiny crack. As I do so, the mangy looking wolf I encountered on the path barges into the hall, his beady eyes darting this way and that.    'I'm going to eat you little piggies!' he snarls. 'Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit.' Then he notices me and his expression turns to one of bewilderment. 'My dear girl,' he says 'we really must stop meeting like this. It is not you I seek, but the Three Little Pigs. I waited two whole weeks for Little Red Riding Hood, after devouring her grandmother who was exceedingly tough and chewy and quite frankly I have had enough of the taste of humans. Go tell those snivelling pigs it's breakfast time!!'   'Here, piggy piggy piggy!' says the wolf, wandering off upwards.
up
In the bedroom I'm in the Three Bears' bedroom, a small attic room with steeply sloping walls. They have the weirdest sleeping arrangements. There's a tiny little bed, a medium sized bed and a huge bed. A narrow staircase leads down to the hall. The Big Bad Wolf is here, doing his best to look mean and dangerous. A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing. For some unaccountable reason, Sleeping Beauty is lying fast asleep on the tiny little bed.
ask wolf about pigs
'Pork! Ah! That most delectable and sumptuous of dishes! By any chance do you happen to know where I might happen upon such a delicacy?'
give pork to wolf
'Here you go, Wolfie!' I say, shoving the pork chops under his quivering nose. He recoils in amateur dramatic horror.    'Cretinous child!' He roars, 'I can't possibly eat those! Do I look like an arctic fox? Am I similar in appearance to a polar bear? Nay, I am a wolf! A wily wanderer of the woodlands! Were I to attempt to eat those my delicate jaws would shatter like glass! Take them away, and don't bring them back until they're medium rare!'

'Well,' says the wolf, 'it was nice talking to you, but I really must be off. Those piggies won't get eaten all by themselves.'  In the hall

In the sitting room From its floral carpet to its lovingly dusted knick knacks, The Three Bears' sitting room is a chintzy abomination of taste, the sort of room that would make any sane bear want to go back and live in a cave.

Moments later, when he has recovered his dignity, he rises to his feet and says    'My dear girl, that was simply exquisite! I am indebted for you for that delectable dish! If there is anything I can do in return, simply name it, and it will be done! Huffing and puffing a speciality...'  [My score has just gone up by three points.]

'Ah, so you wish to make use of my prodigious talents! I shall huff, and I shall puff, and I shall have that turbine turning in a jiffy!' True to his word, the wolf huffs, and he puffs, and he blows the turbine with a gale force blast of air that sends it spinning like a toy windmill.    'My debt is paid, dear child   I shall now return to the forest which is the natural habitat of a fearsome predator such as I. I bid you adieu!' With that he gives a low bow, at which point the oil can falls from the top of the turbine and bops him on the head. With a cluck of annoyance he hitches up the hem of his nightdress, hops over the fence and disappears into the forest.  [My score has just gone up by three points.]

Unfortunately the rotting skeleton manacled to the wall is only too real. A sign on the wall opposite the skeleton says 'When we say NO TRESPASSERS we mean NO TRESPASSERS!' Something for the bears' victims to think about while they languish in this dump. The passage leads south back to the cellar.

(to yourself) 'ALAKAZAM!' Immediately the magic porridge pot begins to fill up with extremely hot porridge. It just sort of swirls up from the bottom of the pot like an expensive special effect. Within seconds the pot is full and the porridge begins to run down the sides...  [My score has just gone up by three points.]
up
I scramble up the rickety steps just in time   a moment later the lower part of the staircase is smashed to splinters by a wave of bubbling porridge. I look back to see the cellar completely submerged in boiling oatmeal.   In the hall  I can see a leaflet, a pair of very thick spectacles and a matchbox here.

In the hall I'm in the entrance hall of the Three Bears' house. Hung around the walls are portraits of various members of the Bear clan, along with some highly disturbing hunting trophies. A narrow staircase leads up to the bears' bedroom. The front door has been wedged open. The trapdoor is open but has been hidden under the bearskin rug.  I can also see a leaflet, a pair of very thick spectacles and a matchbox here.

In the bedroom Lying in the middle of the floor with all four legs pointing heavenward is a dead coach horse. A tiny dormer window looks out onto the clearing.  I can also see a rather thin blanket here.

Office This room is large administration office with two desks stacked with papers, which behind sit two office workers, one male and one female. There are corridors emitting from this room in every direction and a sign on the wall that seems to explain where each of these corridors goes.  A male secretary sits at a desk to the west, working furiously  A female secretary sits at a desk to the east, not appearing to be doing much work The male secretary gives the female secretary a baleful stare.
x sign
The sign reads: "South: Cell area. North: Main ship deck. East: Guards bar. West: Officers Quarters."
x male
The male secretary wears a very prim and proper three piece suit   jacket, shirt and trousers, with a tie neatly dividing his torso in two. Every so often he stops furiously scribbling with his pencil to glare at his female counterpart across the office. The female secretary looks wistfully towards the bar, before turning back.
x female
The female secretary is casually dressed, although she is not to scruffy. She doesn't appear to be doing nearly as much work as her male workmate across the office and spends a fair amount of time twirling her pen around in her fingers with a far away look on her face. The female secretary gets her purse out and powders her nose.
n
"You cannot pass without proper paperwork!" snorts the male secretary. "Sorry, hon." says the female secretary. "You can't pass without paperwork, unless you bribe us of course." She giggles foolishly. You can't go that way. The male secretary gives the female secretary a baleful stare.
ask male about female
He rolls his eyes. "That damn infernal woman never does any work. She makes the place so bally untidy as well." "How I wish I was an officer, so I could make Daddy proud." says the male secretary.
ask male about work
"Something you'll never catch madam over there doing!"
ask male about officer
"I so wish I was an officer, just like Daddy." says the male officer wistfully. "There's an officers convention soon, if I could attend then surely I could impress my superiors. If only I had an invitation...."
ask male about invitation
The male officer suddenly perks up. "You have an invitation for the officers convention?" he asks eagerly. Seeing you don't, he gives you an evil stare and sets back down to his work.
ask male about daddy
"You leave my dear daddy out of this!" The female secretary gets her purse out and powders her nose.
ask female about male
"Isn't he so uptight?" says the female secretary. "Never lets his hair down, always working."
ask female about bar
She flutters her eyelashes. "If you can get me the job in the bar, so I can get away from this dump and that sour puss." She points across the room to her co worker. "Then I'll let you pass through." "How I wish I was an officer, so I could make Daddy proud." says the male secretary.

Bar Finally, a bar! Somewhere to quench your thirst for a pint of smooth, creamy ale...Your mouth begins to dribble, until you realise you have no money to speak of.... Your heart sinks, and you pause to take in the surroundings. It looks rather like a 20th century wine bar, with classy furnishings well placed around the room. There is a large sign on the wall.  A barman beams at you from behind the bar.  You can also see a juke box here.
x sign
"Barmaid wanted!" reads the sign, "Ask Sandy the barman about 'job' for more info."
x barman
Sandy the barman is a fine figure of a man, standing some six feet tall. His head is topped by masses of ginger curls below which there are thick ginger eyebrows. To finish the image off, some ginger whiskers bristle underneath his nose. He's beaming quite hugely at you.
x juke
It's a raging stonker of a duke box! If you know your juke boxes, and you surely do, it's nothing less than one of the now legendary Rock Ola's, from 1961. It appears to be jammed on tracks from Genesis.
ask barman about job
"Here's the application form, it's really quite simple." explains the barman, "Just give it to whoever wants the job and get them to fill it in. I assume you're not applying for the job as a barmaid." He laughs and winks at you. You hear Phil Collins singing his heart out on the juke box.

He looks like one of those old style military men, and displays several medals on his green jacket. This jacket is kept company by a pair of green trousers, which you can just see from behind the desk. He displays a bristling moustache which is surrounded by the red, puffy mass of his face.

This must be your 30th time up the stairs today, but fortunately, this is your final trip. All the laundry and cleaning are done, the carpets shampooed and the beds made. All that's left to do is to put away the last load of laundry, make a cocktail, and unwind in a hot bath while the carpets dry.   However, as you attempt the last of fourteen steps, your foot finds a small toy car inconveniently located as to cause your feet to go west while your head goes east. East, a direction typically no worse than any other direction, unfortunately at this time offers the corner of a banister. Your head's progression is significantly hampered by this obstruction, and as the resulting 'THUMP' resonates throughout the house, your head decides it isn't worth staying awake to investigate further.  You awake somewhat later to find your head no worse for wear but a little foggy, a little confused, and more than a little out of touch....

Your head feels surprisingly good considering your previous antics. In fact, you feel quite refreshed from your hiatus from consciousness.
stand
Just as you start to move, a grizzly little man about four feet tall wearing a red scarf and a black cowboy hat comes in from the bedroom to the north. After a quick glance, the little man bends over and extracts your gold watch from your wrist in one swift movement. As the man examines the watch, a raspy voice yells out, "Frank, get yer carcass outta here and down below where ya belong. Dadgummit anyhow!" The startled little man looks around and runs to the north with spurs clattering. Something drops from his pocket during his hasty exit.

You clamber to your feet.  Upstairs Hallway The upstairs hallway is really nothing more than an annex between several other rooms of the house. There are exits leading north, northeast, east and south. A stairway leads down to the west.  You can see a blue gumball and a little toy car here.
get gum
As you reach for the gumball, a little gnomish man in a cowboy hat comes in from your bedroom and picks up the gum, examines it and says:  "Well looky here, I thought I heard a commotion up here. Ol' Frank Biscuit thought he was goin' to pull off a fast one I reckon, stealin' my special gum and all. What that hick won't do to raise hell! One of these days, Beetlebaum and I are goin' to have to do sumpin 'bout him. Please excuse me, ma'am."  The little gnome tips his hat and heads off to your bedroom.

Master Bedroom While considerably better than your children's rooms, your room is also a little bit on the messy side. There is a king size bed here with mountains of assorted pillows. A masterfully finished dresser graces the south wall. To the south is the hallway and a bathroom is off to the west.  You can see a little gnome here.
x gnome
The little man stands about three feet high, has a dark brown beard and steely blue eyes with a mischievous gleam to them. He is wearing a tattered tan cowboy hat and a pair of cowboy boots that look several sizes too large. He also sports a decorative brown belt with a huge brass belt buckle engraved with the word "GEORGE." In one hand, the little man is carrying a brown bag.  The little gnome stares at you as if he were sizing you up.

"Well ma'am, sorry to trouble y'all with ol' Frank there, but he shouldn't be botherin' you no more. Why don't y'all take this here bag for yer trouble. I best be gettin' back. So long!"  And with that the little gnome sets down the bag, opens the closet door, enters the closet, and then closes the door. You hear George mumble a few words from behind the door and then the muffled sound of machinery. Then all is silent. For some reason, the closet door won't budge.

There isn't all that much room to move around since the place is cluttered with cauldrons, books, a large dusty table, pencil sketches, and assorted equipment.

No doors or other exits are evident except for the weathered ladder leading to the trap door in the ceiling, which is the sole source of light for this room.

You quickly begin to have misgivings about this whole thing as the smell of wildflowers wafts through the air. Mere misgivings give way to total apprehension as your focus starts to return...                        (Press SPACE to Continue)

s
Beaver Dam A small stream flowing from the west is only slightly hampered here by a deteriorating beaver dam which has formed a large deep pool of crystal clear water. Chokecherry bushes line the perimeter of the pool confining access to the pool to the area in which you are standing. The air is thick with mosquitos and gnats.  There is a flat faced rock here, protruding just above the surface of the pool.  On the chokecherry bushes is a small bunch of berries.  The mosquitos and gnats start to eat you alive, forcing you to leave while you still can.

Deadeye Gulch You are at the outskirts of what you would guess is a small town. Tumbleweeds and debris litter the trail giving all appearances that this place is deserted. The majority of buildings and other structures are to the west while a large barn like building is due north. There is a faded sign just off to the side of the trail.

w
East Main Street You are at the east end of Deadeye Gulch on a street which is thick with dried grass and weeds. The remains of hitching posts and water troughs line the crumbling wooden sidewalks. Most of the buildings here have collapsed from aging timbers and a few appear as if they were burned down to their foundations. A couple of structures, however, have withstood the elements. To the north, there is a bank judging from the declaration as to such in the windows. To the south, there is a saloon.
w
West Main Street Most of the buildings on this end of town have given up the ghost and are but piles of broken lumber, tarpaper and other debris. One structure, to the north, seems to have fared considerably better than its neighbor to the south. The street narrows to the west where it appears to pick up a trail leading out of town. Back to the east is the center of town.

General Store The musty smell of rotting wood greets your arrival at this rather dark dry goods store. An empty wood and glass counter parallel to the east wall displays mere remnants of the grains, sugar, fruit, and candy once plentiful in each of the adjacent bins. The shelves behind the counter are now only a repository for dust and a framework for countless cobwebs. The wooden floorboards, once sanded and polished, are now buckled and decrepit. A pair of broken doors leads out to the south and an open screen door leads to the west.  One of the floorboards squeaks when you step on it.  On the shelves are a stack of gum base and a box (which is closed).

Garden This small fenced in area was once a garden, probably for the private use of the store's proprietor. Weeds now blanket the dark soil where once beans, carrots, potatoes, and the like thrived in the hot summer. In one corner of the garden, however, a single corn stalk has made its way skyward supported by the fence. A screen door to the east leads back into the store.
x stalk
The corn stalk is dried to a crisp from the lack of water and there isn't a single ear left. There are, however, a couple of kernels of corn tucked away in the leaves of the stalk.

Unattended Trees The east west trail here is lined by scraggly sycamore trees that look more dead than alive. Even the few birds' nests tucked away in the upper branches look poorly constructed and uninhabitable.
u
After selecting a promising candidate, you carefully scale the trunk. After a few moments you find yourself at...  Tree Top The upper branches of this tree are almost totally bare of leaves. One branch within reach supports a deserted bird's nest which looks a whisper away from nonexistence. Further travel up the tree does not look promising since, basically, there is no more tree.

On the left hand side of the machine are five small wheels. Above each of the wheels is a letter, which collectively spell out the word "AHEAD."

"Deadeye use to be a nice place to live. Lots of good people from all 'round came to live here. Heck, ya could leave yer horse on the street fer a week and nobody'd mess with it."  "One day back a spell, Black Thad started to hang out 'bout town. He were more a pain in the neck than anything. He didn't bother folks much at first. Oh sure, he'd shoot up the place and pick a fight at the drop of a hat, but he didn't hurt folks too much."  "'Tweren't long after the Spring rains when Black Thad picked, of all things, a fight with a goshdarn woman at the saloon. Heck, ya know, Thad was just havin' some fun and the gal shot his thumb off. Now I'll tell ya, Thad was mean before, but thar weren't no puttin' up with him after he gone and lost his thumb to a woman. He started shootin', killin', robbin' and gettin' real nasty. When folks started to call him 'Thumbless Thad' he took it real personal and tried to burn down the whole damn town."  "Well, as if things' tweren't bad enough, he even shot the sheriff and made us bury him without his boots. Well, that was the last straw and folks 'round here just headed out of town. Moved to HerringVille, most of 'em. The few folks that did stay to tend the mine and the oil well were driven out by the Biscuit Brothers and the like who grew quite partial to a town without a sheriff. Soon the whole town just went to the ghosts and if 'twerent fer me, I reckon there'd be nothin' left. Now without ma place and horse, I be thinkin' I best be wanderin' up to HerringVille."

The gum isn't as sweet and flavorful as one might have hoped, but, all in all, it's a good chew. The flavor does not last very long and, in fact, the gum itself doesn't last very long. In an instant, the gum dissolves leaving nothing but a sagey taste in your mouth. Nonetheless, you are feeling a bit perkier and your fingers are starting to twitch.
drink whiskey
Your head starts to spin...  Saloon The ol' saloon is hoppin' tonight! Dance girls (ahem) swarm the dusty patrons, encouraging them to drink and gamble amongst other indiscretions. Above all the whoopin' 'n hollerin', you can just make out the tinny ragtime of an unseen brass tack piano. The barkeep is shoveling out drinks to the bar at a furious pace while one of the other hired help polishes the wall length mirror. Swinging doors lead back to the street to the north.  You can see a table here.  When one of the patrons isn't looking, John Bro swaps his drink for an empty glass.
x barkeep
The barkeep looks somewhat familiar. He has curly brown hair heavily seasoned with gray, a lightly bearded face, and  a slightly paunchy stomach. The local clientele seem to refer to him as "John Bro" or just "Bro" for short. Without exception, every time someone orders a drink, John Bro bellows out "Done Deal!" and then serves both the patron and himself a drink.  The bartender pulls out a small gun and polishes the barrel on his sleeve.

Hey barkeep, I should shoot yer ears off for lettin' this wench clutter up mah place here!"  Saloon The ol' saloon is quieter than a church. Patrons and dance girls line the walls to avoid being in the line of fire. The barkeep is huddled behind the bar occasionally peeking out to view the situation. The rest of the hired help is nowhere to be seen.  You can see Black Thad McGee and a table here.
x thad
This is the meanest looking bad guy you hope to ever set eyes on. Narrow beady eyes stare at you from a grizzly shaven face. Twin scars, one each cheek, accentuate a bent nose which veers slightly off to the left. His dusty black clothing is well worn and is bulging at the seams from the massive physique contained within.  Black Thad's oversized hands continually twitch just over the handles of his pearl handled guns. "Well missy, how 'bout you give me a big ol' kiss and I'll forget I ever laid eyes on yer miserable hide?"
shoot thad
You close your eyes and let out a shot in the direction of Black Thad McGee. The shot veers left, hitting his right hand pistol and knocking it to the floor. The bullet ricochets off the pistol and hits the wall length mirror dead center. The whole mirror gives way, crashing to the floor.  Black Thad shouts, "What ya did that for?!" holding his right thumb in obvious pain. Your victory, however, is somewhat short lived as one of the dance hall girls grabs the whiskey bottle and shatters it against your head. As your consciousness starts to fade while you're staring point blank at the floor, you surmise that the woman just might have been Black Thad McGee's girlfriend.   Saloon This old beer hall served its last cold one many summers past. The rosewood bar stretches from wall to wall and, unsurprisingly, only a few shards remain of the once wall length mirror in back of the bar.

An ore car rests on the tracks at the top of the knoll. The car is tied by rope to a timber header at the end of the tracks.

The old accordion honks, wheezes and spews out clouds of dust. Somehow though, through the melee, a couple of tones do manage to escape.  The Tombstone Jay immediately breaks out of its circling pattern and goes into a dive straight at you! At the last moment before collision, the crazy bird releases the yellow object and breaks out of the dive. The yellow object is true to its mark and smashes into the accordion, destroying the instrument on the spot. As the bird flies away to the north, it is apparent that the Tombstone Jay is overly critical of accordion music.

Suddenly, a rather soiled if not rotting individual comes up from behind and grabs you by the ear. He pulls hard, dragging you through town, and lectures,  "Dadgummit anyhow! You folks think you can come into town and shoot up the place, gamble til dawn, and swear any damn where ya please. Just cause I'm dead don't mean there ain't no law in this town."  The bootless man loses about half a dozen heavily yellowed teeth during this brief oration as well as two fingers off of his left hand. A large red worm crawls out of his right ear, meanders down his shriveled neck and nestles in the tattered clothing around his tarnished badge.  "Ya just can't trust folks anymore to follow the laws. Hell, just because yer six feet under, folks don't have no respect fer ya."  The stench of the little man becomes almost overwhelming as he finally approaches his destination. He unlocks the jail door and flings you into the cell.  "Now, you be mindin' yerself or I'll be stringin' ya to a tree!"  The sheriff strolls off in the direction of Boot Hill, losing part of his nose in the process.  Jail This small jail was not designed for the comfort of its occupants.

Beetlebaum races off through the brush at breakneck speed, stripping you of all your possessions. The landscape flies by as the old horse seeks the shelter of George's shack so as not to have to brave the oncoming blizzard. Following nearly invisible trails, the horse breaks out of the brush onto the main trail. Without hesitation, the horse continues north along the trail across Clear Creek and then northeast toward Blind Canyon.  As the horse makes the last turn into the canyon, Beetlebaum startles at the sight of something up ahead on the trail. At this point, you and the horse go your own separate ways. Beetlebaum falls to the ground, quickly regains his footing, and continues his journey north to shelter. You, on the other hand, fly through air with the greatest of ease until falling face first onto the dusty trail.  As you get up and take inventory of your faculties, you feel something cold against your head and hear the click of a gun's hammer.  Blind Canyon The trail winds its way from the southwest through a shadowy canyon formed in the cleft of two large hills. You cannot help but feel confined and vulnerable by the sheer walls of this gorge and the limited visibility in front of you and behind. The trail continues to the north.  You can see Black Thad McGee here.  "Well, what do we have here? Huh, little missy? Seems like you and me have some unfinished business."  Thad puts the pistol back into the holster.  [Your score has just gone up by fifteen points.]

Black Thad McGee looks more like a mortician than a cowpoke. The only exception to his solid black clothing and hat is a red bandanna loosely fitted around his neck. While the two massive ammo belts crisscrossing his chest are impressive, the one thing that really catches your eye is the stump of a thumb on his right hand.  "Yuh see now, you kinda spoiled my shootin' with your little tricks. Yuh know, it's pretty damn hard for an old guy like me tuh make a livin' without a good shootin' hand. But I learned. Yah, I learned to use muh other hand. Sure the boys laughed a spell 'bout it, but I done showed 'em just like I is goin' to show yuh.

wait
Time passes.  Black Thad pulls out a pistol from his holster.    Black Thad's eyes turn big as saucers as he spots the daunting sight of George and Beetlebaum racing down the trail at full gallop. Beetlebaum's eyes are filled with rage, his nose flared, and thick white foam spews from his mouth. Just as Beetlebaum lowers his head for a full charge, George screams out in an earsplitting yell, "HERE COMES BEETLEBAUM!"  Black Thad, out of reflex, goes for his right gun first to shoot the charging horse. His thumbless hand fumbles the gun around and then drops it to the ground. In an instant, but an instant too late, he goes for his other gun with his good hand. Beetlebaum, with his ears back, plows into Black Thad like a freight train. Black Thad is launched into the air from the collision and slams into the canyon wall. What life may have been left in Black Thad is certainly concluded by the ensuing rockslide.  After the dust clears a little, George stares at you for a moment and says, "I just knew you'd be the one to clean up around these parts. Heck, when I tricked ol' Frank into goin' above to rile yuh up, I could just feel it in mah bones. Beetlebaum, get yer miserable hide over here!"  As Beetlebaum saunters over, still wet with sweat, George opens the saddlebag and takes out a blue gumball and hands it to you. "Go on, get on home! I don't take to no good byes from no woman." George pauses, and then breaks out in a big smile and chortles, "Ah heck, ya done good. Hell, ya done great. I's can't thank ya enough fer helpin' out. Let's get some grub and get ya on yer way."  After a pleasant meal of beans and jerky, you say your good byes to the old cowboy. Following a long hug and a quick peck on the cheek, you finally partake of the blue gum. Quicker than an instant, you find yourself....                      (Press SPACE to Continue)

Release 29 / Serial number 840118  Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol issue self contained multi purpose all weather scrub brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.  Deck Nine This is a featureless corridor similar to every other corridor on the ship. It curves away to starboard, and a gangway leads up. To port is the entrance to one of the ship's primary escape pods. The pod bulkhead is closed.

Time passes... A massive explosion rocks the ship. Echoes from the explosion resound deafeningly down the halls. The door to port slides open.
W
Escape Pod This is one of the Feinstein's primary escape pods, for use in extreme emergencies. A mass of safety webbing, large enough to hold several dozen people, fills half the pod. The controls are entirely automated. The bulkhead leading out is open. The ship shakes again. You hear, from close by, the sounds of emergency bulkheads closing.
GET IN WEB
You are now safely cushioned within the web. The pod door clangs shut as heavy explosions continue to buffet the Feinstein.
WAIT
Time passes... You feel the pod begin to slide down its ejection tube as explosions shake the mother ship.
WAIT
Time passes... Through the viewport of the pod you see the Feinstein dwindle as you head away. Bursts of light dot its hull. Suddenly, a huge explosion blows the Feinstein into tiny pieces, sending the escape pod tumbling away!
WAIT
Time passes... As the escape pod tumbles away from the former location of the Feinstein, its gyroscopes whine. The pod slowly stops tumbling. Lights on the control panel blink furiously as the autopilot searches for a reasonable destination.
WAIT
Time passes... The auxiliary rockets fire briefly, and a nearby planet swings into view through the port. It appears to be almost entirely ocean, with just a few visible islands and an unusually small polar ice cap. A moment later, the system's sun swings into view, and the viewport polarizes into a featureless black rectangle.
WAIT
Time passes... The main thrusters fire a long, gentle burst. A monotonic voice issues from the control panel. "Approaching planet...human habitable."

Time passes... The pod is buffeted as it enters the planet's atmosphere.
WAIT
Time passes... You feel the temperature begin to rise, and the pod's climate control system roars as it labors to compensate.
WAIT
Time passes... The viewport suddenly becomes transparent again, giving you a view of endless ocean below. The lights on the control panel flash madly as the pod's computer searches for a suitable landing site. The thrusters fire long and hard, slowing the pod's descent.
WAIT
Time passes... The pod is now approaching the closer of a pair of islands. It appears to be surrounded by sheer cliffs rising from the water, and is topped by a wide plateau. The plateau seems to be covered by a sprawling complex of buildings.
WAIT
Time passes... The pod lands with a thud. Through the viewport you can see a rocky cleft and some water below. The pod rocks gently back and forth as if it was precariously balanced. A previously unseen panel slides open, revealing some emergency provisions, including a survival kit and a towel.
GET OUT OF WEB
As you stand, the pod shifts slightly and you feel it falling. A moment later, the fall stops with a shock, and you see water rising past the viewport.
GET KIT
Taken.
OPEN DOOR
The bulkhead opens and cold ocean water rushes in! The pod is now completely submerged, and you feel it smash against underwater rocks. Bubbles streaming upward past the window indicate that the pod is continuing to sink.
OUT
Underwater You are momentarily disoriented as you enter the turbulent waters. Currents buffet you against the sharp rocks of an underwater cliff. A dim light filters down from above.
U
Crag You have reached a cleft in the cliff wall where the island rises from the water. The edge of the cleft displays recently exposed rock where it collapsed under the weight of the escape pod. About two meters below, turbulent waters swirl against sharp rocks. A small structure clings to the face of the cliff about eight meters above you. Even an out of shape Ensign Seventh Class could probably climb up to it.
U
Balcony This is an octagonal room, half carved into and half built out from the cliff wall. Through the shattered windows which ring the outer wall you can see ocean to the horizon. A weathered metal plaque with barely readable lettering rests below the windows. The language seems to be a corrupt form of Galalingua. A steep stairway, roughly cut into the face of the cliff, leads upward. A rocky crag can be seen about eight meters below.
U
Winding Stair The middle of a long, steep stairway carved into the face of a cliff.
U
Courtyard You are in the courtyard of an ancient stone edifice, vaguely reminiscent of the castles you saw during your leave on Ramos Two. It has decayed to the point where it can probably be termed a ruin. Openings lead north and west, and a stairway downward is visible to the south.
N
Plain Hall This is a featureless hall leading north and south. Although the hallway is old and dusty, the construction is of a much more modern style than the castle to the south. A similar hall branches off to the northeast.
NE
Rec Corridor This is a wide, east west hallway. Portals lead north and south, and another corridor branches southwest.
E
Mess Corridor This is a wide, east west hallway with a large portal to the south. A small door to the north is closed and hooked with a simple steel padlock which is also closed.
E
Dorm Corridor This is a wide, east west hallway with openings to the north and south. To the east, the corridor stretches off into the distance. That section of the hallway is lined with a motorized walkway (no longer running) that was probably intended to transport people or cargo down that tremendously long hall.
E
You walk down the long, featureless hallway for a long time. Finally, you see an intersection ahead...  Corridor Junction A north south corridor intersects the main corridor here. To the west, the main corridor extends as far as you can see; a non working walkway from that direction ends here. To the east, the corridor widens into a well lit area.

Repair Room You are in a dimly lit room, filled with strange machines and wide storage cabinets, all locked. To the south, a narrow stairway leads upward. On the north wall of the room is a very small doorway. Lying face down at the bottom of the stairs is a motionless robot. It appears to be damaged beyond repair. Floyd follows you. Floyd points at the fallen robot. "That's Achilles. He was in charge of repairing machinery. He repaired Floyd once. I never liked him much; he wasn't friendly like other robots. Looks like he fell down the stairs. He always had trouble with one of his feet working right. A Planner person once told me that's why they named him Achilles."
TELL FLOYD TO GO NORTH
Floyd squeezes through the opening and is gone for quite a while. You hear thudding noises and squeals of enjoyment. After a while the noise stops, and Floyd emerges, looking downcast. "Floyd found a rubber ball inside. Lots of fun for a while, but must have been old, because it fell apart. Nothing else interesting inside. Just a shiny fromitz board."
TELL FLOYD TO GET SHINY BOARD
Floyd shrugs. "If you say so." He vanishes for a few minutes, and returns holding the fromitz board. It seems to be in good shape. He tosses it toward you, and you just manage to catch it before it smashes.

Infirmary You have entered a clean, well lighted place. There are a number of beds, some complicated looking equipment, and many shelves that are mostly bare. Lying on one of the beds is a small red spool. On a low shelf is a translucent bottle with a small white label. At the bottom of the bottle is a small quantity of medicine. Floyd bounds into the room. "Floyd here now!" he cries.
GET BOTTLE
Taken. Floyd, rummaging in a corner, finds something and carries it to the center of the room to examine it in the brighter light. It seems to be the breast plate of a robot, along with some connected inner circuitry. The entire piece is bent and rusting. Floyd stares at it in complete silence. A moment later, he begins sobbing quietly, awkwardly excuses himself, and runs out of the room. You look at the breast plate, and notice the name "Lazarus" engraved on it.

LOOK THROUGH WINDOW
You can see a large laboratory, dimly illuminated. A blue glow comes from a crack in the northern wall of the lab. Shadowy, ominous shapes move about within the room. On the floor, just inside the door, you can see a magnetic striped card. Floyd stands on his tiptoes and peers in the window. "Looks dangerous in there," says Floyd. "I don't think you should go inside." He peers in again. "We'll need card there to fix computer. Hmmm... I know! Floyd will get card. Robots are tough. Nothing can hurt robots. You open the door, then Floyd will rush in. Then you close door. When Floyd knocks, open door again. Okay? Go!" Floyd's voice trembles slightly as he waits for you to open the door.

The door opens and Floyd, pausing only for the briefest moment, plunges into the Bio Lab. Immediately, he is set upon by hideous, mutated monsters! More are heading straight toward the open door! Floyd shrieks and yells to you to close the door.

The door closes. From within the lab you hear ferocious growlings, the sounds of a skirmish, and then a high pitched metallic scream!
WAIT
Time passes... You hear, slightly muffled by the door, three fast knocks, followed by the distinctive sound of tearing metal.

The door opens. Floyd stumbles out of the Bio Lab, clutching the mini booth card. The mutations rush toward the open doorway!
CLOSE DOOR
The door closes. And not a moment too soon! You hear a pounding from the door as the monsters within vent their frustration at losing their prey.  Floyd staggers to the ground, dropping the mini card. He is badly torn apart, with loose wires and broken circuits everywhere. Oil flows from his lubrication system. He obviously has only moments to live.  You drop to your knees and cradle Floyd's head in your lap. Floyd looks up at his friend with half open eyes. "Floyd did it ... got card. Floyd a good friend, huh?" Quietly, you sing Floyd's favorite song, the Ballad of the Starcrossed Miner:  O, they ruled the solar system Near ten thousand years before In their single starcrossed scout ships Mining ast'roids, spinning lore.  Then one true courageous miner Spied a spaceship from the stars Boarded he that alien liner Out beyond the orb of Mars.  Yes, that ship was filled with danger Mighty monsters barred his way Yet he solved the alien myst'ries Mining quite a lode that day.  O, they ruled the solar system Near ten thousand years before 'Til one brave advent'rous spirit Brought that mighty ship to shore.  As you finish the last verse, Floyd smiles with contentment, and then his eyes close as his head rolls to one side. You sit in silence for a moment, in memory of a brave friend who gave his life so that you might live.

A melodic high pitched voice says "Miniaturization and teleportation booth activated. Please type in damaged sector number."
TYPE 384
You notice the walls of the booth sliding away in all directions, followed by a momentary queasiness in the pit of your stomach...  Station 384 You are standing on a square plate of heavy metal. Above your head, parallel to the plate beneath you, is an identical metal plate. To the east is a wide, metallic strip.
E
Strip Near Station You are standing on a silicon filament, which looks to you like a wide metal highway. South of here, the filament makes a right angle and heads straight down, like a cliff overlooking a black void. The filament can be followed north, however. Station 384 lies westward.

Middle of Strip You are standing on a section of the strip with a bottomless void stretching out on both sides. The strip continues to the north and south.

LOOK INTO RELAY
This is a vacuum sealed micro relay, encased in red translucent plastic. Within, you can see that some sort of speck or impurity has wedged itself into the contact point of the relay, preventing it from closing. The speck, presumably of microscopic size, resembles a blue boulder to you in your current size.

Suddenly, with a loud plop, a giant elephant sized monster lands on the strip just in front of you. It is amorphously shaped, its skin a slimy translucent red membrane. While most of your brain screams with panic about the disgusting monster that now blocks your exit, some small section in the back of your mind calmly realizes that this is merely some tiny microbe which has somehow violated the sterile environment of the computer interior.  As you stand frozen with fear, the microbe slithers toward you, extending slimy pseudo pods thick with waving cilia. It looks pretty hungry, and seems intent on having you for lunch.  Middle of Strip A hungry microbe blocks your way, its cilia waving and its pseudo pods towering over you. The monster wriggles nearer. It is now so close that you can make out details in the protoplasm beneath its translucent skin.
THROW LASER INTO VOID
As the laser flies over the edge of the strip, the hungry microbe lunges after it. Both the laser and the microbe plummet into the void. (Whew!)

A voice seems to whisper in your ear "Main Miniaturization and Teleportation Booth has malfunctioned...switching to Auxiliary Booth..." You feel the familiar wrenching of your innards, and find yourself in a vast room whose distant walls are rushing straight toward you...  Auxiliary Booth This is another small booth. Unlike the Miniaturization Booth, this room has no slot or keyboard, so presumably it is intended only as a receiving station. The exit is on the northern side.

Lab Office This is the office for storing files on Bio Lab experiments. A large and messy desk is surrounded by locked files. A small booth lies to the south.

Some of the experiments seem to be out of control... A ferocious feral creature, with a hairy shelled body and a whip like tail snaps its enormous mandibles at you. A giant plant, teeming with poisonous tentacles, is shuffling toward you on three leg like stalks. Lurking nearby is a vicious looking creature with slavering fangs. Squinting in the light, it eyes you hungrily. Rushing toward you is an ugly, deformed humanoid, bellowing in a guttural tongue. It brandishes a piece of lab equipment shaped somewhat like a battle axe. The air is filled with mist, which is affecting the mutants. They appear to be stunned and confused, but are slowly recovering.

H.P. Lovecraft                                                  November, 1997.   You take a deep breath of salty air as the first raindrops begin to spatter the pavement, and the swollen, slate colored clouds that blanket the sky mutter ominous portents amongst themselves over the little coastal town of Anchorhead.  Squinting up into the glowering storm, you wonder how everything managed to happen so fast. The strange phone call over a month ago, from a lawyer claiming to represent the estate of some distant branch of Michael's family, was bewildering enough in itself... but then the sudden whirlwind of planning and decisions, legal details and travel arrangements, the packing up and shipping away of your entire home, your entire life...  Now suddenly here you are, after driving for the past two days straight, over a thousand miles away from the familiar warmth of Texas, getting ready to move into the ancestral mansion of a clan of relatives so far removed that not even Michael has ever heard of them. And you've only been married since June and none of this was any of your idea in the first place, and already it's starting to rain.  These days, you often find yourself feeling confused and uprooted.  You shake yourself and force the melancholy thoughts from your head, trying to focus on the errand at hand. You're to meet with the real estate agent and pick up the keys to your new house while Michael runs across town to take care of some paperwork at the university. He'll be back to pick you up in a few minutes, and then the two of you can begin the long, precarious process of settling in.  A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder    fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones. Shouldn't it be snowing in New England at this time of year? With a sigh, you open your umbrella.  Welcome to Anchorhead...

Alley This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.  High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom style window.
Push can against wall
Grunting and holding your breath, you manhandle one of the filthy cans under the window.

Push play
For a while there is nothing but a quiet hiss, followed by intermittent skirls of strange sounding static. It sounds like one of those annoying glitches where the caller hangs up but the machine keeps recording anyway. Then, barely audible through the static, you detect what sounds like a human voice whispering a single word:  "Verlac."  The machine beeps.  A brief shudder ripples up your back. You remember now, "Verlac" is the name of this branch of Michael's family.

Founded some time in the early 1800s, the school's reputation and enrollment have diminished somewhat as Anchorhead drifts further and further into the abyss of provincial backwaterism. Still, it is generally recognized for its collection of folklore and esoteric mythology (one of the oldest and most extensive on the east coast). The Board of Deans was also kind enough to offer Michael a full professorship upon hearing of his recently discovered heritage and his plans to move into the estate. Ivory tower, perhaps, but at least they take care of their own.  There are numerous buildings surrounding this cobbled court, but the only one you are interested in is the library to the west, where Michael told you he'd be until he came back to the real estate agent's office to pick you up. Which, incidentally, he has not yet done.
West
You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.  Library Shadows roost thickly in the vaulted ceiling, and small, green shaded desk lamps cast pools of warm radiance here and there around the library's dim interior. You pause a moment to let the hushed peacefulness of this place soak in    a welcome relief from the unsettling events of the day. An exit lies east, and a small alcove to the north houses the circulation counter.  Peering through the shadows, you spot your husband sitting at one of the reading desks, absorbed in some sort of weighty tome and clearly oblivious to the time.
Read book
Michael looks up, startled, then realizes it's you and smiles. "Hi, hon," he says, closing the book and stretching. Then he glances at his watch. "Good grief, what happened to the time? I'm so sorry    I just lost track." He smiles sheepishly.  "Well?" he asks. "Did you get the keys?"
Show keys to Michael
"Great!" says Michael. "You hang on to that. Just a second, I'll put this back." He takes the book up to the circulation desk and hands it to the librarian. "Okay then," he says, returning, "let's go."  Michael suddenly smacks his forehead. "Oh, crap, I forgot to tell you. The car broke down." He spreads his hands. "I don't know what happened to it; one second I'm parking outside, the next second it dies and I can't get it started again. I called a tow truck, but the nearest garage is up in Arkham. They picked it up but won't be able to look at it until next week at the earliest. Anyway, it looks like we'll have to walk back to the house." He offers you a lame smile. "You can hold the umbrella."  Your score has just gone up by two points.

The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella.

SE
Junction To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.  Michael hurries to catch up.
East
Narrow Street As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.  Michael strolls along after you.  Michael makes a weak attempt to whistle.
South
Whateley Bridge A hoary monument of crumbling, moss eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.  Michael strolls along after you.
South
Town Square A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.  In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.  Michael follows you.
East
Riverwalk A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.  Michael hurries to catch up.
South
Chilly Avenue Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.  A clammy mist hangs thickly in the air, seeping through your clothes and making you shiver.  Michael hurries to catch up.  Michael scuffs around dispiritedly.
SW
As you walk through, the mists part before your husband almost deferentially, quickly dissolving away into nothing.  The ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.  Scenic View The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.  Michael follows you.
NW
Outside the House The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.  The fabled Verlac family mansion looms before you in the gloom, its dark creaking presence dominating the clearing and, somehow, even though it is not visible through the trees, the entire valley. The foreboding shadow of the Verlacs seems to enshroud all of Anchorhead from here.  A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.  Michael hurries to catch up.  "Well," says Michael, "this must be the place. We finally made it, honey. We're home!"  The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.
Unlock door
You unlock the front door.
North
(opening the front door first) You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.  Foyer Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.  The front door stands open to the south.  Carelessly stacked in a towering heap in the middle of the room are all your luggage and belongings, which you had sent ahead through a moving company before driving up to Massachusetts. Everything you own is boxed away and piled up in the middle of the floor. The reality of this move finally slams home as you stare at the sprawling jumble of stuff, and suddenly you feel very lost and adrift.  Night has now undeniably fallen, and the house is very, very dark. There is probably just enough residual ambience to feel your way upstairs to the bedroom, but the rest of the house is a tenebrous maze of shadows, and any exploring would probably best be done in the morning.  Michael follows you.  Michael stretches his arms and yawns. "Well," he says, "I think I'm going to turn in. There'll be plenty of time to unpack and explore tomorrow. Good night, hon." He kisses you on the cheek. "Don't stay up too late."  And with that, he goes upstairs.

Upstairs Landing A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.

Master Bedroom The master bedroom is a picture postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house.  Michael is curled up in bed, sound asleep.  If it weren't for this hopelessly backwater town and the disturbing circumstances surrounding the house, you'd say this was your dream home. Even so, as much as you would like to relax and enjoy the comforts of a fully furnished historical New England estate, you can't help but be put off by the shady aura surrounding the family that used to live here. The last of the line, you remind yourself, recently committed suicide after killing his wife and two daughters with a shotgun. Involuntarily you shiver, glancing nervously at the doorways to the south and west.
Undress
You take off the trenchcoat. You take off the clothes.

West
Bathroom A small chamber of cold, white tile and floral print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.
Bathe
Grateful for the opportunity to relax, you draw a hot bath (the water, at least, is running, even if nothing else in the house is) and soak. The tension of this strange day melts gently from your body. After thirty minutes or so, you begin to feel normal again. After forty five, you begin to think you might be able to adjust to this place after all. By then the water has begun to cool off, however, so you drain it and quietly dry yourself off. All in all, you feel enormously better.  Your score has just gone up by one point.

Lie in bed
Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.  Michael rolls over and mutters something in his sleep.
Sleep
Almost immediately you fall asleep, and as the wind slithers around the eaves and the house creaks furtive secrets to itself, you drift into troubling dreams...
Look
You are waiting in your bed, with the coverlet up under your chin, waiting for Father to come tuck you in. Footsteps in the hall pause outside your door. You close your eyes; when you open them again Father is standing at the foot of the bed. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and you wonder if he has been crying. Slowly, he starts to take off his belt.  Only it's not your father after all, it's Michael. He hands you a golden sphere and says:  "I don't know what it opens yet but I have an idea."  Your reflection is like a little doll trapped inside the sphere. Everything is tinged with gold. Your face swells and stretches comically as you stare back at yourself through the curved, distorting walls. Reaching out, your fingers curve back on themselves... the wall breaks and...  You are running from the eyes, the terrible red rimmed eyes, through endless, narrow corridors of wooden slats and crumbling plaster. You stumble through turn after turn, hopelessly lost. There is a small hole in the boards    peering through it you see Michael in the study, typing diligently away. You scream, you pound on the wall, but he can't hear you. The red rimmed eyes draw closer; hurrying down a twisting passage you find a dead end... the wall breaks and...  Outside, you stand at another dead end, a high brick wall at the end of a steep, twisting lane. Written in black spraypaint...  He always returns to his blood.  Behind you, you hear the buzzing of a fly. You

It is always a relief to get                                               clear of the place.                                                                                                 H.P.

You wake up. Steam billows gently by, and you can hear the sound of running water coming from the bathroom.
Get wallet
With a nervous glance toward the bathroom, you slip the wallet from Michael's pants.
Open wallet
You open the wallet, revealing Michael's faculty card.
Get card
The shower suddenly stops. Quickly you palm the card, replace the wallet and arrange the pants the way you found them. A moment later Michael emerges from the bathroom, toweling his hair. "My, don't you look tempting this morning," he says, giving you a kiss. He tosses the towel back into the bathroom and gets dressed. "I think I'm going to stay home and get some writing done. I don't actually start work until tomorrow, so..." He kisses you on the cheek as he walks out into the hall. "If you go out today, see if you can find a newspaper. I want to learn as much as I can about this town."  He looks at you for a moment, and his voice becomes serious. "I love you, hon. You know that, don't you? I really want us to try and be happy here."  Then he turns and pads down the hall.  You take a deep breath as he goes. You've never lied to Michael or hidden anything from him before, ever; now, hardly two days into your new life, you're already sneaking through his wallet.  Oh yeah. You're off to a great start.
Leave bed

Dining Room Much of the elegance has faded from this room. The huge dining table running the length of it is covered with a thick gray film of dust, and the china cupboard standing against the far wall is draped in shadow. Doorways to the north and east offer little relief from the gloom. For what must be the hundredth time, you wish you could open the windows in this place.
Open cupboard
The cupboard is empty; the china must have been auctioned off, in the confusion before Michael was contacted, perhaps. Down at the bottom of the cupboard is a velvet lining, where the silverware would usually be kept.
Pull lining
You pull the lining back a bit further and discover a thin, palm sized journal tucked underneath it. Intrigued, you pull the little book free.  Your score has just gone up by two points.

It's a slim little book, no bigger than your hand, bound in imitation leather. The mice really have been at it; most of the pages have been chewed away.  What's left of the journal reads:  Desperate.

North
Kitchen Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.  Someone's flashlight is lying on the kitchen counter; one of the movers must have left it.  An odd feeling of gloom overtakes you momentarily, and you find yourself thinking about the Verlac family's personal effects    the everyday mundanities, such as kitchen utensils. Were they thrown out, or donated to charity, or auctioned off as grisly souvenirs? What about the canned goods? Did anyone think to take them? The cabinets might even still be stocked. Morbidly, you wonder what Mrs. Edward Verlac might have been cooking for dinner the night her husband blew her head off.
Get flashlight
(slipping the faculty card into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the flashlight. It's battery powered, and waterproof too, by the look of it.  The flashlight is currently switched off.

Down
(opening the cellar door first) You descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.  Cellar The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.  One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.
South
Storage Old crates and boxes piled high against the walls make this room seem even smaller and dingier than it actually is, which is saying a lot. A doorway lies north; the other walls contain nothing but shadows and dirt filled corners.
Search crates
You spend some time poking dispiritedly through boxes of second hand table settings, discarded shoes and outdated encyclopedias, but the only thing you manage to dig up is an old cardboard box full of newspaper clippings, which might make interesting reading later if you can find the time. The only thing at all noteworthy about the room, in fact, is that it desperately wants cleaning; there's even a big, nasty looking spider web in a corner behind one of the crates.
Get box

Back Hall A short hallway, connecting rooms to the east, west and south.
East
Gallery A long, oak paneled room, with doorways to the south and west. Paintings line the walls, mounted beneath small, shaded lamps that would illuminate the canvasses nicely if only the electricity were working. Still, even in the shadowed gloom you can see that all were done by the same artist.
Look at paintings
All of them are bizarre, and most of them border on the grotesque. Alien landscapes peopled by writhing, malformed creatures; ancient temples built in strange, eye bending architectures; monstrous beasts crawling through shadows that cannot quite conceal their disturbingly human shapes    these seem to make up the bulk of the paintings' subject matter. And yet, despite the fantastical nature of the images painted, the style is neither abstract nor surreal. In fact, the level of detail approaches the photorealistic. Excruciating attention has been paid to light, shadows, and textures; even the alien creatures are depicted with gruesome anatomical accuracy. It is as though the artist had worked from actual, living models rather than from what must have been a thoroughly deranged imagination, and the overall effect is rather chilling.  One scene in particular catches your eye.
Look at scene
A somewhat Boschian scene, depicting a line of naked, emaciated men, their ankles shackled and chained together, shuffling forward to offer obeisance to the glowing maw of an enormous furnace. The men are malnourished and covered with terrible burns. The foremost is kneeling, offering... something, you can't make out what... up to the mouth of flames, while the rest stand as far back as they are able, their heads bowed in what appears to be fear and penitence. It isn't clear where this is supposed to be taking place; beyond the fiery glow there is nothing but soot filled, Stygian blackness. An artist's rendition of Hell, perhaps?  For some reason, you are reminded of old photographs of the Nazi death camps, in which Jews were forced to feed the ovens with the corpses of their own.  You shake yourself suddenly, and realize you've been staring intently at the painting for minutes on end. You step back and rub your tired eyes. When you look again, however, the picture you were just examining is no longer in front of you. None of the other paintings have moved as far as you can tell, but that particular scene seems to have disappeared without leaving so much as a blank space on the wall.
South
Sitting Room The east wall is occupied by a beautiful antique sofa, and a large, hand woven rug covers the hardwood floor. The huge marble fireplace in the north wall helps complete the impression of comfort and warmth, and for a moment or two you can almost think of this place as somewhere you could live, as opposed to merely somewhere others have died. The foyer lies west, and a doorway to the left of the fireplace leads north.  Your brief sense of comfort quickly drains away, however, as you become aware of the icy and maniacal stare emanating from the great portrait hanging over the mantelpiece. Under the malefic gaze of those red rimmed eyes, the most comforting thought you can muster is that of immediate flight.  On the sofa is a family album.
Get album
You pick up the family album. It's a slim, hardbound volume in dark leather, unadorned except for name "Verlac" embossed on the front. Glancing at the title page, you notice two details: one, the book was self published; and two, it was published in 1944. So it's a good bet that Edward Verlac and his family aren't mentioned here.
Look up Wilhelm in album
That's not a name you're familiar with. Since the family album is filled with names you're not familiar with, you are unable to get very far looking for it.

Library Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark paneled, green carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window, with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how easily this place could have been the perfect home.  A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors stand closed to the east.  Resting on the pipe stand is a sizable volume decorated with a gilded pentagram on its cover.

(The Compleat Manual of Wardes and Seales) You pick up The Compleat Manual of Wardes and Seales. It's an old medieval tome dated in the early 1300s, written by one Galarian Academius desChamps.
Look at bookshelf
Literally hundreds of books stuff the shelves, many of them thick, cracked, leather bound tomes with ribbon place holders and titles lettered in raised gold leaf. It would take you years to peruse them all. However, one interesting title does catch your eye. An authentic first printing of Edgar Allen Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination, shelved incongruously between volumes "G" and "H" of the Encyclopedia Americana.
Get Poe
The book sticks stubbornly at first, and, thinking that it must be tightly wedged in between the encyclopediae, you give it a fierce jerk. Suddenly, the book slides halfway out, then pops back in with a loud "snick".  Amazingly, a section of the bookshelf slides back, revealing a hidden safe.  Your score has just gone up by one point.

puzzle box: (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the puzzle box. It's roughly the size and shape of a cigar box, carved from some dark and oddly streaked wood that you can't identify. All six surfaces are decorated in a complex arrangement of grooves and panels, most of which are illustrated with leering, demonic faces and obscene designs.

Children's Bedroom This must be the children's bedroom. The bed is smaller than the one in the master bedroom, its bright coverlet providing one of the few feeble splashes of color in what must have been, for most of its history, a joylessly Puritan household. A small vanity table occupies the opposite wall, and in the corner under the window stands an ancient crib. The only exit is to the north.  A child's jewelry box sits on the corner of the vanity.

Get pages
(slipping the puzzle box into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the bundle of soggy pages. It appears to have been someone's diary. There must have been a leak at some time behind the wall where it was hidden, because most of the pages are water logged and completely illegible. However, portions of a few entries remain untouched.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
Read pages
Carefully, you turn the tattered pages. The handwriting is that of a young girl. You idly wonder if this might have been the diary of one of Edward Verlac's daughters    but then you notice part of a date, just visible in the corner of the page: 1953. This must have been written, then, several years before Edward was born.  The entries that are legible read as follows:  ...Father came again to my bed last night... mother doesn't... tells me I can't... to be a good daughter. Sometimes it hurts, but Father always tells me I shouldn't cry. Father says a daughter must do her Duty if she wants to get into Heaven. And I do want to get into Heaven...  [this entry dated 1957] ...my poor little William. Father calls him an aberration, child of the Devil, but I don't believe... locked in the attic. I go to see him whenever Father is away. I sing to him, sometimes, through the keyhole, and slip him sweets through the crack under the door... my baby is beautiful... can't let him hurt my dear baby William... to the doctor, and he has a plan... I can never... this locket, William, and I will always keep yours... to always remember my face...  Nothing else is readable except for one fragmented entry near the very end of the book, the date in the corner reading February 27, 1961:  ...dead, but not dead yet... will not allow him to do to Edward what he wanted to do to William... have learned... given him the charm against the... never take it off, dear Edward... [a page has been torn away] ...fear to sleep... mist at the window     And that's all.

(opening the iron door first) The faint echo of dripping water and a musty smell of decay grow stronger as you descend.  In the Crypt The air is clammy and frigid, the stone walls damp and streaked with mud and lichen. Pale, swollen roots push through cracks in the masonry. The smell of damp corruption is almost overpowering here, though the stairs to the south lead toward fresher air.  The walls of this chamber contain dozens of wide, shallow niches; in each niche, a coffin.
Examine coffin
Rank upon rank of the ancient Verlac family remains are stacked away in this hole, left to crumble and deliquesce together, merging back into the dark matter which gave them birth. Above each niche is a nameplate indicating who was buried here and when they died.
Look up William on nameplate
(in the nameplates) The nameplate reads "William Verlac, b. June 22, 1954, d. September 18, 1958". Unlike the others, William's coffin is a ramshackle affair of cheap pine, held together with rusting nails. It's half rotten with age and so shabbily built you could probably open it with your bare hands.
Open William coffin
Compelled by a gruesome curiosity, you dig your fingers under the soft, rotting boards and pry up the lid. With the shriek of pulling nails and a shower of crumbling wood, the coffin comes open, and you look inside, expecting to find a child's tiny skeleton...  Dear God.  There's no child buried here. Instead, the coffin contains only the worm eaten bones of some kind of animal.  Who would have buried an animal in place of the child that should have been interred here? And why would they do such a thing? Glumly, you look around at the rest of the coffins, and realize that anyone who might have known the answers to these questions is probably already buried in this room.

Scenic View The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.

The front page story is about Jeffrey Greer, 8 years old, who was abducted from his home at #11 Mill Town Road last night. Little Jeffrey is the latest victim in a series of abductions that stretches back for years, one every six months or so, and that authorities believe is the work of a single perpetrator. Local police had hoped to prove that Edward Verlac had been behind the kidnappings, but were unable to obtain a confession or any hard proof. Edward Verlac was convicted of murdering his wife and two daughters, one of whom was 15 months old, in January of this year; he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and incarcerated in Danvers Asylum, where he remained until committing suicide last March. This latest kidnapping, occurring after Edward's death, seems to have cleared up any lingering suspicions that he might have been the culprit.  Anyone possessing information regarding the whereabouts of Jeffrey Greer is strongly urged to speak to the authorities as soon as possible.  The cold wind cuts through your clothes, chilling you to the bone.

"It was her father's poison seed, y'see. That evil bastard poisoned her womb and put a monster inside her. What she gave birth to... it was... it wasn't... oh, God, when I held that... that abortion in the shape of an infant, that thing with hooves for feet and its crown of writhing... when it looked up at me... It looked up at me with its father's red rimmed eyes." The old man shudders convulsively, and it is a while before he can speak again.  "Anna and I decided between ourselves, we did. The... her child... it lived for a few years, but it was sickly, and in pain, and it could never be normal nor healthy. She brought it to me... I was her doctor, you see, I'd seen her through her child's birth, and she trusted me... and I put the thing down, softly and without pain, and they laid it to rest in the family crypt.  "And Anna thanked me for it, so she did."  The old man falls silent again, and his wavering, bloodshot eyes wander once more out to sea. And he is lost, once again, to the horror and pain of the memories that can only be silenced by drink.
Ask bum about Anna
Tears stream unchecked down the old man's face. "Shouldn't have happened to the girl. Only seventeen, she was, still a child when he... when that red eyed monster took her... " His eyes suddenly darken, his fists clench. "HIS OWN DAUGHTER, GODS FUCK 'EM! SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER! GODS FUCK 'EM ALL!!"
Ask bum about crypt
The old man stares at you suspiciously. "William was buried in the family crypt, at his mother's request, so he was; what're you getting at?"
Tell bum about skull
The old man bares his teeth. "You can't prove it! You can't prove anything, so you can't!"
Show skull to bum
(first taking the animal's skull) The old man grows sickly pale. He raises one hand, as if to ward off the sight of the skull, deny the truth one more time; then his hand drops, and he sinks down onto the mattress, groaning.  "Oh, it's true," he cries, "it's true, God help my lying soul. It was her father who wished to kill the thing, not Anna    kill it to make way for another, he said, a 'more fitting vessel'. He wanted to try again    Gods, the depth of his evil    after the way the first one came out, he wanted to try again!  "Anna came to me and asked for my help, and what could I do? What could I do? It was her child, for God's sake, no matter what else it was, and she couldn't bear to lose it. But we had to weigh the coffin down with something..."  He sits up, suddenly, fastening on you with a sick, pleading look.  "I've told you too much, now," he whispers desperately. "They'll know; the maggots'll find out for sure. They'll find me; even in my hole, they'll find me." He lets out an eye wateringly pungent breath, "P'raps it's best they do. I've spent so long drowning my sins, p'raps time's come to pay for them at last. This won't do me much good no more," he says, holding up his little copper key. "And yet..." He closes his fist around it again. "And yet, maybe there's a way... they say there's ways to protect yourself, wards versus the Evil Eye and such. " The old man stares greedily at the amulet around your neck. "Perhaps, if I could get me one o' those..."
Give amulet to bum
"Thank you kindly, Miss, you're a generous one, so you are," grins the old man as he closes his grimy fingers around the charm. "And here y'are," he says, tossing you the copper key. "I'll pray it does you good."  The old man staggers to his feet. "I'll be gettin' on, then," he says. "If I can make away before nightfall, p'raps I'll be out of their reach before the maggots come out." He wraps the leather thong around his hand and closes the charm in his fist.  He turns to you one last time. "Don't let them find you," he says earnestly. "Get out while you can. If you stay, they'll track you down eventually. It's the blood. He can smell it, so he can. And he always returns to his blood."  He shambles off, up the riverwalk toward Town Square, his shadow dragging long behind him. Looking to the sky, you realize that the sun is nearly set; you've been talking to the old man for much longer than you thought, and it will be dark soon.  Your score has just gone up by five points.

SE
Wharf The gentle creaking of hawsers and the hollow slap of water beneath the wooden pier provide a faint counterpoint to the endless, rhythmic surging of the sea. The fishing industry (like the paper industry) has all but died away in Anchorhead; nonetheless there are still a few boats tied to the pier. A path leads back through an opening in a chain link fence to the northwest; otherwise, it's just you and the ocean.  An old, discarded tin of fish oil sits at the end of the pier.
Get tin
(slipping the puzzle box into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the old tin. It's dented and rusty, and you can barely make out the words "Skagen, Denmark" printed along the side. The lid is closed.  The cold wind blows harder, tugging at the hem of your trenchcoat.
NW
Vacant Lot Where once a building stood, there is now only cracked pavement and rampant weeds. A high chain link fence surrounds this vacant lot; the only breaks lie to the west and southeast.  A filthy old mattress lies among the weeds over in one corner of the lot.  You can also see a flask (which is empty) here.  A gust of wind blows your hair into your face.
West
Riverwalk A low, irregular brick wall to the north divides this street from the steep, mud slick banks of the sinuous Miskaton, while a rusty iron gate provides access to a precarious flight of stone steps leading down the bank to the water's edge. The street bends south here, turning into a misty avenue between the trees. The town square lies west, a vacant lot lies east.
South
Chilly Avenue Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.
SW
The ground begins to rise sharply as the road climbs up into the hills south of town.  Scenic View The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.
NW
Outside the House The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.  The front door stands open to the north.  The Verlac mansion looms before you, casting an air of menace over the clearing.  A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.
North
Foyer Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.  The front door stands open to the south.  Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.  You call out to let Michael know you're home, but no one answers. The house is still, hushed; an eery prickling walks up your back like centipede legs. Michael isn't here, you realize. The house is empty. You are alone.

You close the front door.

Library Whatever else their faults may have been, the Verlacs were evidently not ones to shun the printed word. Books line the walls from floor to ceiling in this dark paneled, green carpeted room, interrupted only by doorways to the east and south. A rich, brown leather armchair sits in stately repose near the window, with a polished brass pipe stand nearby completing the picture of some blue blooded country squire's literary refuge. Once again, you are struck by how easily this place could have been the perfect home.  A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors stand closed to the east.  A section of the shelves in the western wall has slid to one side, revealing a hidden safe.
East
(opening the sliding doors first)  Study This smaller room adjoining the library seems comfortable enough, although it is dusty and cluttered from having not been lived in for the better part of a year. Aside from the desk and the chair and the empty shelves, the only real feature of the room is the large, ornate fireplace in the southern wall.  A beautiful pair of mahogany sliding doors lead west, to the library.  Michael's laptop sits in the middle of the desk, humming quietly to itself. Also on the desk is a letter opener.
Get letter opener
(slipping the animal's skull into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the letter opener. It's a rather ornate thing, with a silver hilt and a slim, sharp tip.
Look at screen
The computer is in screen saver mode: blank except for a single window requesting a 4 digit user passcode. Odd; you didn't think Michael ever used the passcode utility.
Remove ring
You slip the plain gold band from your finger. Usually you feel almost naked without your ring on, although sometimes you do find yourself taking it off briefly, just to read the inscription along the inside.
Look at ring
Engraved along the inside are Michael's and your initials, along with your wedding date    June 28th.
Wear ring
The gold band slides onto your finger with a comforting snugness.
Type 0628 on laptop
(on the laptop) The passcode window disappears and the screen suddenly fills with text, apparently the last thing Michael was working on before he got up and left.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
Look at screen
Michael has evidently been writing something, but it's not a story; it looks more like some kind of journal entry.  I cannot sleep.  Or perhaps I should say: I must not sleep, since I am perfectly capable of sleep    in fact, lately sleep has come to me more easily, more quickly, and more insidiously than it ever has before. But I don't want to sleep.  I have been hoping that the terrible dreams would prove to be stress related, that they would fade once the move was behind us and we had finally settled in    but that has not turned out to be the case. They're stronger than ever. Red rimmed eyes pursuing me through strange corridors, and the voice    the whisperer who tells me I am not who I am. The whisperer tells me secrets of this house, secrets of those who lived here    they are my blood, and he tells me he always returns to his blood. He tells me of secret keys and combinations; I don't know what they open yet but I have an idea     Tomorrow I must go down to the cellar. I must see if the things revealed to me in that terrible book are true.  I know she is worried about me. I want to tell her, but     The entry ends there, unfinished.

Pull cord
With a rusty, ratcheting groan and a brief shower of dust, the trap door swings down and folds back, revealing a rickety wooden ladder leading up into darkness.
Up
The ancient rungs creak alarmingly as you ascend.  Attic It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the ceiling dips even lower until the space beneath leaves hardly room enough to crawl, while to the north stands a wooden door, draped in shadows and half hidden by the slanting eaves.
Push newspaper under door
You slide the newspaper under the door, leaving only an inch or two sticking out on your side.
Put letter opener in keyhole
The tip of the letter opener bumps against something, and you hear something thump onto the newspaper on the other side of the door.
Get newspaper
(slipping the old tin into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) Something metallic falls off the newspaper as you pull it out from under the door.
Get brass key
(slipping the letter opener into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the old fashioned brass key. It's an old key, the kind with a round barrel about a quarter inch in diameter and flat, square teeth.  Your score has just gone up by one point.
Put brass key on keyring
The old fashioned brass key is now on the keyring.
Unlock door
(first taking the keyring) You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after several false attempts you discover that the old fashioned brass key fits the lock. You unlock the door.
North
(opening the door first)  Attic Cell A cramped little annex off the main attic, with a tiny, shuttered window high up on the north wall. A pile of mouldering straw in the corner and what looks like pencil marks on the lower part of the walls seem to indicate that someone lived here once. Or, possibly, was kept here.
Search straw
You gingerly poke through the filthy straw, barely able to suppress your disgust. However, your search is not unrewarded: underneath the thickest part of the pile, you discover a tiny gold locket.
Get gold locket
(slipping the newspaper into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the gold locket. It is oval shaped, held shut with a tiny clasp.

Master Bedroom The master bedroom is a picture postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.
West
Bathroom A small chamber of cold, white tile and floral print wallpaper. It sports a genuine, whitewashed, claw foot bathtub with a shower attachment, which is a definite plus. The bedroom lies east.  Michael's bath towel lies crumpled in the corner, next to the tub.
Get towel
(slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the towel. It's still a little damp from Michael's shower, but otherwise it's a perfectly ordinary bath towel.

You take off the trenchcoat. You take off the clothes.
Drop all
towel: Dropped. gold locket: Dropped. lantern: Dropped. flashlight: Dropped. trenchcoat: Dropped. clothes: Dropped.
Lie in bed
Gratefully, you crawl into bed and pull the covers up to your chin.
Sleep
You lie awake for what seems like hours, listening to the house creak and settle around you and wondering where your husband is. You try to convince yourself that he merely went for a walk and lost track of the time, as he is so often wont to do. In any case, with no telephone and no car, there is little you can do besides hope that he will turn up in the morning. With your worried thoughts chasing themselves endlessly around your mind, you eventually drift off into an uneasy sleep...
sleep
Down the road and through the woods, where the whippoorwills call their lunatic's song, you are running. The sky boils and thunders overhead. The red rimmed eyes glare down at you. When you look up at them, they merge together, melting into a single, baleful orb    a swollen, bloody moon.  You must escape. You veer off the road, tripping over an old, rotted stump, pushing aside a twisted sapling. Vines and brambles tear at your clothes. Rocks cut your feet. But still you must run, until you suddenly burst out of the underbrush, into a tangled, moonlit clearing.  An ancient, flagstone well stands amidst the weeds in the clearing's center, and you are drawn to it. Something is moving inside, scratching at the stones down in that circle of blackness, and for some reason all you can think is the basement, Michael is in the basement, and he's doing something bad...  Heart hammering, you lean over the crumbling lip. Your hair slips from your shoulders, dangling tantalizingly close to the well's opening...  ... the whippoorwills reach a crescendo...  Your eyes adjust to the dark and you see           you see the most horrible thing

sleep
You wake up, shivering. Michael is in bed next to you, sleeping like a dead man with the sheets wrapped in a twisted snarl around his body.
Leave bed
Reluctantly, you do so.  Master Bedroom The master bedroom is a picture postcard of rustic New England charm. Faded sketches of rural landscapes adorn the walls; a beautifully carved dressing mirror stands in one corner; an old fashioned accordion radiator gurgles quietly beneath the window. The most striking feature, an enormous, antique, four poster bed, must be the largest piece of furniture in the house. Doorways lead west and south.  Your clothes lie in an untidy pile on the floor.  Your trenchcoat is here.  Michael is sprawled across the bed, sound asleep.  You can also see a flashlight, a lantern, a gold locket (which is closed) and a towel here.
Dress
(first taking the clothes) You try to get dressed as quietly as possible, but apparently Michael isn't as knocked out as you thought he was. Michael comes awake with a jerk and a hoarse shout. For a moment or two he only stares about blindly, as if unsure of where he is and all but unaware of your presence. Then, with a grunt of surprise, he seems to come to his senses and painstakingly crawls out of bed.  Michael wanders off to the south, muttering something about "needing privacy..."
Wear coat

Get all
flashlight: Taken. lantern: Taken. gold locket: Taken. towel: Taken.

Look at fireplace
The fireplace is carved from beautiful, dark veined marble, a strange shade that is not quite a deep, forest green and not quite a murky, dusky red. The mantelpiece is flanked by a pair of polished brass spheres.
Turn sphere
The sphere twists clockwise a few degrees, there is a barely audible "click", and the sphere snaps back into its original position. Suddenly, the entire fireplace slides about eighteen inches to the left with a hollow grinding sound, revealing a narrow corridor in the southwest wall.
SW
Narrow Corridor The walls are bare wooden slats, patched with crumbling plaster and spiked with bent, rusted nails. The passage, no more than two feet wide at its widest point, bends and twist at confusing angles, making it hard to tell which direction you're heading in.

Narrow Corridor The walls are bare wooden slats, patched with crumbling plaster and spiked with bent, rusted nails.

Look in hole
(the small hole) Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see the children's bedroom. Through some strange trick of the angle, you appear to be looking straight down at the bed from the middle of the ceiling.  Suddenly Michael walks into the bedroom. He moves slowly, looking around and lightly touching things, as if visiting old memories. He walks over to the crib and spends some minutes staring down into its empty blankets, after which he sighs. Then he turns and adjusts the coverlet on the child's bed.  He walks over to the vanity and picks up the jewelry box. Carefully, he opens it and, finding it empty, sets it down again with a soft curse. He looks around the room suspiciously, as if expecting to find the culprit hiding in a corner somewhere. For a moment Michael simply stands there aimlessly, compulsively rubbing his forehead; then he stalks out of the room and is gone.

(the small hole) Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see the sitting room, from a vantage high up on the wall. It occurs to you that you might well be looking directly through the eyes of the man in the portrait hanging over the fireplace.  At that moment, Michael wanders into the sitting room, muttering something incoherent. He looks around blankly, lost, as if he had come into the room in order to do something only in the next instant to forget what it was. Then his eyes fall on you, and he smiles.  You nearly jerk away from the spyhole, heart pounding wildly, when it suddenly occurs to you that he's not looking at you at all; he's looking at the portrait through which you are peering.  Michael regards the portrait with a strange air of familiarity. He gazes into its eyes (and also, unbeknownst to him, your own eyes) the way one might appraise an old friend one hasn't seen for some time. His expression is deferential, admiring, and... something else; you can't quite put your finger on at first, but as your husband continues to gaze rhapsodically at the terrible portrait, a sickening realization strikes you.  The expression is vanity. Ugly, self absorbed vanity. Your husband is staring at this portrait the way he might preen himself in a mirror.  Michael brushes his fingers back through his hair and walks out of the room, chuckling softly to himself.
NW

There is a small hole in one of the slats, about halfway up the wall.
Look in hole
(the small hole) Standing on tiptoe and placing your eye up to the hole, you see only darkness.  Just as you are about to move away from the spyhole, you hear footsteps on a stone floor. A light shines in through a doorway, and a moment later Michael skulks into the room, which you now realize is the wine cellar, seen from down low in a corner, near the floor.  Halfway across the room he stops, darts a suspicious glance over his shoulder, and shines his light into every corner, as though searching for potential spies. At one point he looks straight at you, and you nearly recoil, alarmed at the sight of his crazed, red rimmed eyes. He does not spot you, however, and in a moment he moves on.  He walks over to the rack at the north end of the room, and does something with the bottles    you can't quite see, because his back is toward you. Then there is a click and a heavy grinding sound, and the entire northern wall swings back, revealing a hidden passage!  The room is filled for a moment with a wild, wretched keening, like a cold wind blowing through an empty chasm. With one last, wary look behind him, Michael steps through the portal. The light disappears, the wall swings back with another grinding sound, and then all is quiet.  Your score has just gone up by two points.

Observatory You are in a small, enclosed cupola situated, by the look of the view through the dingy skylight over your head, on top of the roof of the house. The walls are covered with astrological and astronomical charts with equations and diagrams scribbled across them in crabbed, stilted handwriting. The only exit seems to be an oddly angled corridor to the southeast.  Dominating the center of the room is a large mounted telescope, pointed almost straight up through the skylight.
Put lens in telescope
(first taking the strange black disk) (slipping the gold locket into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) The strange black disk drops neatly into the slot.
Look in telescope
For a few moments all you can see is a murky, swirling blackness; then patterns of colors begin to emerge, like the rainbow sheen of oil on water. The black disk grows translucent, stars become visible through the swirling haze, and then...  Dear Christ.  Dear Christ, you can see it.  The comet, roaring silently through the endless void, streaking toward Earth, and it's alive, this thing that is coming is ALIVE, tendrils that must be hundreds, thousands of miles long streaming before it, reaching out to grasp and strangle and devour whole worlds, and it is coming here, it is coming to Earth, and its great, lidless, red rimmed eye rolls over in a vast lake of vitreous fluid, and it        looks            at                              you                                                ...you wake up some time later, shaking your head. You're not sure what, exactly, you just witnessed; whether it was a genuine astronomical phenomenon, or a hallucination, or the actual form of some Dark God from the Outer Reaches, come to devour the world. You're not even entirely sure you remember what it looked like. The only thing you can clearly recall is a single name, pulsing in your brain like a bruise:  "Ialdabaoloth".  And that's all.

As you make your way down the corridor, you begin to get dizzy, then nauseous. Lines seem to cross without bending, the ceiling becomes the walls and the floor becomes the ceiling.

The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.  Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.
North
Back Hall A short hallway, connecting rooms to the east, west and south.
West
Kitchen Where once pots and skillets and various utensils hung in profusion, the kitchen walls are now merely ranks of dusty cabinets and a forest of empty hooks. Doorways lead east and south, a small pantry lies to the northwest, and the back door to the north leads out of the house.
NW
Pantry The pantry is empty save for a layer of dust on the shelves. A door to the south leads down to the cellar, or you can return to the kitchen to the southeast.  The cellar door stands open, revealing dark stairs leading down.
Down
You descend the gloomy steps into the dank cellar.  Cellar The old, flagstone walls gleam with unwholesome smelling moisture, and the sagging timbers creak uneasily above your head. Ancient, frayed wiring festoons the ceiling like some strange species of clinging vine. Portions of the cellar extend south and east into the clammy darkness, though you could always beat a hasty retreat up the stairs to the north.  One largish bundle of wires leads down to a rusty old fuse cabinet bolted to the far wall.
East
Wine Cellar This wing of the cellar is even older than the rest, with walls of piled, unmortared stone. The entire room is filled with wine racks. They cover every wall except for one spot to the west, where an exit leads back to the main cellar.  All of the racks are dust covered and empty except for one against the north wall, which contains some forty or fifty dark bottles.  You are reminded of something Michael told you during the long drive up: about how when the police arrived after the shooting, they found the wine cellar in a shambles    nearly every bottle thrown to the floor and shattered, and the whole place reeking of rotted grapes. All except the bottles in the north rack. None of those had been touched. No one could posit a motive for it.  You smile a bit, recalling your husband's ability to turn a piece of insignificant trivia into a compelling story. Still, though, now that you're actually standing here... it all seems very strange.
Search wine rack
There are five bottles in the third row from the bottom that have been handled recently; the fingermarks are clearly outlined on their dusty labels. One label is partially torn and the other is all but faded completely, but at a quick glance you count a Pinot Noir, a Cabernet Sauvignon, and a Cheval Blanc.
Turn c
The bottle with the faded label rotates a quarter turn clockwise, then snaps back with a loud "click".
Turn w
(the robust Pinot Noir) The bottle of robust Pinot Noir rotates a quarter turn clockwise, then snaps back with a loud "click".
Turn h
The bottle of vintage Cabernet Sauvignon rotates a quarter turn clockwise, then snaps back with a loud "click".
Turn e
(the bottle with the torn label) The bottle with the torn label rotates a quarter turn clockwise, then snaps back with a loud "click".
Turn m
The bottle of light Cheval Blanc rotates a quarter turn clockwise, then snaps back with a loud "click". A rumbling grating sound suddenly fills the wine cellar, and the racks and a portion of the stone wall behind them swing back, revealing a dark passageway to the north from which blows a hot, foul wind.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
North
You take a few cautious steps into the corridor, when the wall suddenly slams shut behind you with a reverberating boom. You are trapped!  Windy Passage The walls of this passageway are carved from solid rock with unearthly precision; ten feet wide, ten feet high, perfectly smooth and perfectly square. The passage runs north, sloping downward into the depths of the hillside. A foul wind gusts intermittently from the darkness below.  Another blast of hot, foul smelling air comes shrieking out of the pit.
North
Edge of the Pit The passageway ends here at a fathomless pit, a puckered circular hole in the rock from which the foul wind seems to emanate, howling up from the depths like a reeking banshee.  A thin and decrepit rope bridge spans the pit, shivering occasionally in the wind.
North
Carefully, you edge out onto the swaying planks. The planks creak and bend beneath your weight. One of them snaps just as you lift your weight from it, coming very close to spilling you into the abyss below. A few more steps, however, and you are safely on the other side.  Other Side The passageway turns east here, the stone floor dropping down in a series of wide steps carved into the living rock. The stairs continue down to the northeast, eventually curving out of sight. The only other way on from here is a narrow, oddly angled corridor in the northwest corner.  A thin and decrepit rope bridge spans the pit, shivering occasionally in the wind.
NE
Great Stairs The vast, stone staircase plunges down into the earth. The seemingly interminable steps curve in a gentle sweep from the southwest, above you, dropping toward black, unplumbed depths to the north.
Down
Bottom of Stairs The stairs end here at a huge, greenish gold door set into the north wall. There is nothing else here; nowhere to go but onward or back.
Say ialdabaoloth
The metallic door suddenly rings out as if struck; it vibrates in aching harmony with the blasphemous name    a shrill, grating sound like a dentist's drill. The air grows thick and terrible shapes waver and melt in the air before you    shapes that twitch and move with hungry purpose, and seem to look at you    and then the ringing fades away. There is a moment of stillness, and then the gleaming door swings smoothly open on perfectly balanced and utterly silent hinges.
North
The doorway opens out into a large, dome ceilinged cavern. You stand at the threshold for a moment, peering into the strange, phosphorescent gloom, before your eyes can make out enough details to see what this place is; even then, it is almost a full minute before your mind can accept what you are seeing...  Burial Mound The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings cover the rock walls in between the niches    grotesque, leering faces too horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the wavering light that sifts down from above.  And dominating the center of the chamber: a dark monolith rising up through the green, murky light    what you first took to be a large, supporting pillar, you now realize can only be the true base of the town square obelisk.  At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg shaped cavern sits a massive stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.
South
Bottom of Stairs The stairs end here at a huge, greenish gold door set into the north wall. There is nothing else here; nowhere to go but onward or back.
Up
You start back up the wide steps...  Great Stairs The vast, stone staircase plunges down into the earth. The seemingly interminable steps curve in a gentle sweep from the southwest, above you, dropping toward black, unplumbed depths to the north.
SW
Other Side The passageway turns east here, the stone floor dropping down in a series of wide steps carved into the living rock. The stairs continue down to the northeast, eventually curving out of sight. The only other way on from here is a narrow, oddly angled corridor in the northwest corner.  A thin and decrepit rope bridge spans the pit, shivering occasionally in the wind.
NW
As you make your way down the corridor, you begin to get dizzy, then nauseous. Lines seem to cross without bending, the ceiling becomes the walls and the floor becomes the ceiling. Half blind, unsure even of which direction you were going in, you stagger forward and suddenly find yourself in a...  Crawlspace The ceiling descends here to no more than three feet from the floor; you are forced to crawl through the cramped darkness on your hands and knees. To the east the attic becomes more spacious, while the northwest corner opens into an oddly angled corridor.
East
Attic It's much cooler up here than in the rest of the house, and you find it hard to suppress a shiver. Grotesque, looming shadows crawl across the low, slanted ceiling, and the dust hangs thick and motionless in the air. To the west the ceiling dips even lower until the space beneath leaves hardly room enough to crawl, while to the north stands a wooden door, draped in shadows and half hidden by the slanting eaves.
Down
The ancient rungs creak alarmingly as you descend.  Upstairs Hall The shuttered window at the end of the hall throws a gloomy rectangle of light onto the bare wooden floor. Doorways lead north and south.  A rickety wooden ladder stands here, descending from a three foot by three foot square of darkness in the ceiling.
West
Upstairs Landing A narrow hallway runs east, from the top of the stairs down the length of the house. To the north, directly opposite the stairs, is the master bedroom.
Down
Foyer Although it appears spacious from the outside, the house's interior feels cramped and gloomy. The walls seem too close together; the ceiling is too high. The doorways, leading in several directions, are narrow and filled with shadows, and the stairs leading up to the second floor are steep and rickety. This is not a house that makes you feel welcome. It is a house that makes you feel tiny and timid, and afraid of dark places. It is a house that makes you feel alone.  Your luggage is still here, spread out all over the foyer.
South
(opening the front door first)  Outside the House The lane runs up from the southeast and ends at a wide clearing surrounded by gnarled and ancient trees. A wide, curving driveway runs up to the front door of your house, which lies north.  The front door stands open to the north.  The Verlac mansion looms before you, casting an air of menace over the clearing.  A typewritten notice has been attached to the front door.  The hairs on the back of your neck prickle as you step outside. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong with the air. A heavy, charged sensation, like standing next to high tension wires; a faint odor of spoiled meat drifting on the wind; you can't put your finger on it, but it might have something to do with that strange hole in the sky.
SE
Scenic View The treeline falls away on the north side of this northwest northeast bend in the road, giving way to a panoramic view of the Miskaton River Valley and the grubby little town of Anchorhead nestled within it. From here you can see the paper mill almost directly to the north; the solitary lighthouse and surrounding ocean to the northeast; and the dilapidated stone church below you to the east. Winding through it all is the oily black ribbon of the Miskaton, and almost directly in the center lies the little clearing of Town Square. You can just make out the shape of the obelisk from here.
NE
Chilly Avenue Perhaps it is merely the effect of some unwholesome vapour rising from the murky waters of the nearby Miskaton, but the temperature along this street seems perceptibly cooler than normal, even for a New England autumn. Two dirt roads lead south and southwest, into the dense woods at the edge of town.  A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in the wind.
South
Deserted Lane The gently winding lane makes its way through the birch woods south of town. New England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the oppressive weather and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the trees.
South
Down the Road The forest grows denser as you go, crowding thickly up to either side of the road. The groping, tangled branches block out what little sunlight there is left. Your footsteps are muffled; whispering leaves and the slow drip of water are the only sounds you can hear. Beyond the watching trees, the shadows are impenetrably thick. The road stretches interminably, north to south.  There's something strangely familiar about the woods here... scenes from last night's dream flicker through your memory, but you are unable to recall the details.
Look at woods
You scrutinize the edge of the road carefully, looking for whatever it was you saw...  There. On the west side. That stump, and the twisted sapling growing next to it; you recognize them. And just beyond them... the path. It's the path you took in your dream, a narrow rut running west through the underbrush. You can hardly believe it, but there it is.  From deep within the forest, you hear the deranged cry of a lone whippoorwill.
West
Trampled Path The tangled undergrowth has been beaten down in a path leading roughly from the east to the southwest. Shrubs and grass have been flattened and pushed aside, vines torn down, and small trees bent or even snapped in half, as though something heavy with huge, flat feet had simply trampled its way through.
SW
Abandoned Slaughterhouse The decayed remains of an old slaughterhouse stand here, now little more than a shell of crumbling brick and gaping holes, surrounded by a clearing of yellow, sickly grass. A path leads northeast, back toward the road; to the west, a gaping hole that might once have been a doorway leads into the rotting building.  The forest is unnaturally quiet here, you notice; there are no birds calling, no leaves rustling or branches creaking; even the whippoorwills have fallen silent. All is still, holding its collective breath in an expectant hush.  The cold wind cuts through your clothes, chilling you to the bone.
West
Crumbled Ruin The roof has collapsed, leaving the interior open to the sky; the floor is nothing but bare, beaten dirt. Gaps in the bricks lead east and south. Although nothing stands now but the tottering, crumbling stonework (and that only barely), you fancy you can still detect a faint miasma of death    a palpable, chilling reminder of the bloody work which once went on within these walls.  There's something odd about the ground here; some faint marking or pattern.  An old rusty meat hook sticks out of the ground nearby, its point half buried in the dirt.  Over in the far corner, a tattered sheet of drawing paper lies discarded on the ground.
Get drawing paper
You pick up the tattered drawing. The drawing is of a pair of crudely rendered figures, scrawled with dark, heavy lines that occasionally punch right through the paper. The two figures are holding hands. The one on the left is a smiling woman with long, straight hair; the one on the right...  Well, you don't know. Frankly, you'd rather not speculate. An octopus on human legs, maybe, if you could believe any healthy child would conceive of such a thing. Above the first figure is scribbled the word "MOMY"; above the second, "WILAM (ME)".
Get Hook
(slipping the towel into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the meat hook. The crossbar fits in your palm, leaving the hook part to stick out between the third and fourth fingers. It's a heavy sucker, nearly fifteen inches long from handle to point, made for hauling around carcasses with a minimum of ceremony. You wouldn't like to think what this could do to a living person.
South
Old Stone Well Beyond the south wall of the old slaughterhouse, there is nothing but a tangled thicket so dense as to be impenetrable in every direction except to the north, where you can slip back into the ruined slaughterhouse through a hole in the wall.  Rising from the midst of the underbrush is a squat circle of stone: the top of an ancient well. A circle of rotting plywood covers the opening.  In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind.
Lift plywood cover
You dig your fingers under the edge of the plywood and, straining as hard as you can, manage to slide the heavy cover off the top of the well and onto the grass.
Down
Carefully testing each foothold, you descend into the well.  In the Well The sky is a dim circle of light far above you. The stone walls press in on you from all sides, and the air is clammy and frigid. A faint odor of decay drifts up from the floor; the smell of a trapped animal decomposing under the back porch.  You are standing knee deep in a rattling jumble of children's bones.
Search bones
You notice a tuft of brown among the yellowed ivory of the bones. Moving aside a clattering pile of ribs, you discover a child's teddy bear.
Get Teddy
(slipping the tattered drawing into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the teddy bear. It is old and threadbare, its fur worn through to the stuffing in some places. Stitched onto its behind is the name "Jeffrey".
Up
You painstakingly climb out of the old well.  Old Stone Well Beyond the south wall of the old slaughterhouse, there is nothing but a tangled thicket so dense as to be impenetrable in every direction except to the north, where you can slip back into the ruined slaughterhouse through a hole in the wall.

There's something odd about the ground here; some faint marking or pattern.
East
You are about to step back through the eastern wall when a noise makes you stop. In the woods outside, to the east    something is there. Something breathing. Something huge.  A branch cracks sharply; and another. It's coming this way.
South
Old Stone Well Beyond the south wall of the old slaughterhouse, there is nothing but a tangled thicket so dense as to be impenetrable in every direction except to the north, where you can slip back into the ruined slaughterhouse through a hole in the wall.  Rising from the midst of the underbrush is a squat circle of stone: the top of an ancient well.  A rotting circle of plywood leans against the side of the well.  The sound of tearing undergrowth grows louder. Whatever it is, it's practically bulldozing its way through the forest.
Down
As quickly as you are able, you scramble down the rough stone walls. Ten feet from the bottom, you slip, landing with a clatter amidst the dusty bones.  In the Well The sky is a dim circle of light far above you. The stone walls press in on you from all sides, and the air is clammy and frigid. A faint odor of decay drifts up from the floor; the smell of a trapped animal decomposing under the back porch.  You are standing knee deep in a rattling jumble of children's bones.  The ground trembles slightly with the thing's thunderous footsteps as it tromps up the path. It's right outside the slaughterhouse!
Hide under bones
You burrow down into the bones, piling more bones on top of you for cover while trying to make as little noise as possible.  You hear it pause inside the building, its hide slithering loudly against the brick walls as it moves about. There is a horrible, wet snorting sound, as if it were trying to pick up a scent, then an unspeakable, inhuman grunt of anger.
Wait
Time passes.  Scarcely daring to breathe, you lie as still as possible beneath your cover of bones as the thing, whatever it is, moves closer. A shadow falls across the mouth of the well, and then the circle of light above you is blotted out by a shape so utterly, blasphemously hideous that it is all you can do to remain conscious. Two grotesquely blue and childlike eyes blink down into the darkness of the well, searching...                                        And then it is gone.  You must have lost consciousness after all, judging from the stiffness in your limbs and the difference in the light. You have no idea how long you were out, but the creature must have passed you by. The forest is still again; the breathing and footsteps, gone.  Involuntarily, you let out a long, shuddering breath.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
Up
The bones fall away, clattering loudly as you stand up.

Deserted Lane The gently winding lane makes its way through the birch woods south of town. New England foliage is famous for its splendid colors in the fall, but the oppressive weather and pervading murk have leached these trees of most of their tint. The road continues south into the increasingly dense forest, and in the other direction heads back to town. A paved walk also leads east through the trees.  A small group of townsfolk has gathered up at the north end of the road. As you approach, still breathless from your encounter with the thing at the slaughterhouse, they turn toward you    and that's when you notice that the one in the lead has an axe in his hand. And the one behind him has a pair of garden shears.  A couple of men move over to your left, and several more step out of the forest behind you. All of them carry weapons or nasty farm implements of some kind, and all of them look as though they're just about ready to put an end to a certain over curious, outsider woman who doesn't know enough to keep her nose out of things better left undisturbed.
East
You dart past the men on your right, making a break for the church. The townsfolk hover around the entrance to the churchyard but do not follow you, confident that there is no way you can escape.  Churchyard A low, wrought iron fence, its spike tipped bars bent or leaning at crazy angles, surrounds the overgrown yard of this dark, abandoned church. A gap in the fence leads back west, while a bare path beaten through the groping weeds leads around the church to the southeast.
SE
The path bends northeast, around the side of the church.  Behind the Church The forest encroaches right up to the iron fence here, some of which is literally buried in the tangled underbrush. There are no doors on this side, although a wooden trap door over by the corner of the building probably leads into a cellar. A path leads southwest, around to the front of the church.
Break padlock with hook
You raise the meat hook high over your head and bring it squarely down onto the padlock. The rusted metal casing splits open, the hasp falls loose, and the padlock, now nothing but a broken shell, slides to the ground.  Your score has just gone up by one point.
Down
(opening the trap door first) As you drop to the floor, the trap door suddenly slams shut above you. You hear noises outside    something thumping against the door, and low voices. You hear someone muttering, and a brief round of unpleasant laughter. Then the voices drift away.  Church Cellar Centipedes and beetles scurry away across the rotten floorboards as you shine your light across the room. Over in the corner sits a hulking shape of black metal that was probably once a wood burning furnace; aside from that, the cellar looks empty. A dark alcove, the shadows within too thick to see through, opens in the west wall, and a trap door in the ceiling leads back up to the outside.  At the very edge of your light's glow, you can just make out a horribly suggestive shape lying in the shadows behind the furnace.
Look at shape
It's the dead body of a woman. Her head has been raggedly hacked away, and her clothes above the waist are soaked through with blood. As you fight to control your rising gorge, you note that the body cannot have been here for very long; the decay, though bad, is not very far advanced. She must have been killed within the last couple of days at most.
Search shape
Gingerly, trying to avoid the worst of the blood, you lift the woman's lapel, hoping to find something    identification, maybe. Her wallet is missing; however, you do find, tucked into the pocket of her blazer, a small, steel key.
Put steel key on keyring
The small steel key is now on the keyring.
Look at furnace
It's a big, pot bellied iron furnace, blackened from years of use, with a hatch on one side and numerous twisting pipes which snake out of the top and grope their way up to the ceiling.
Open hatch
Your throat tightens as you slowly open the bloodstained hatch...  Slow horror washes over you. You found exactly what you expected to find, of course. It's the real estate agent's severed head.
West
Empty Stairwell This alcove used to house a stairwell leading up and down; now it contains only a few rotted boards jutting from the walls and an empty shaft dropping down out of sight. Above you hang the broken off remains of the stairs leading up to the ground floor, the last shattered riser only a couple of tantalizing feet out of reach.
 Put all in pocket
teddy bear: You slip the teddy bear into the pocket of your trenchcoat. meat hook: You slip the meat hook into the pocket of your trenchcoat. lantern: It wouldn't be very wise to put the lantern in your pocket while it's still burning. flashlight: You slip the flashlight into the pocket of your trenchcoat.
Jump onto riser
You take a few steps back, draw in a deep breath, and make a dash for the edge. At the last possible second you jump, sailing out over the pit as you make a desperate grab for the bottom riser...  ... and catch it.  Unfortunately, you lose your grip on the lantern while trying to grab the riser, and it tumbles into the darkness below.  The riser bends ominously under your weight but doesn't give. Panting, you haul yourself up onto the creaking stairs.  Broken Stairs The stairs stop short about seven feet shy of the basement floor, the bottom most steps hanging suspended over an empty shaft that descends beyond sight into the shadowy depths. What's left of the structure creaks and shifts uneasily under your feet. At the top of the stairs to the north, a doorway opens onto the ground floor of the church.  The creaking under your feet is getting louder.
North
Vestibule A dim antechamber, opening onto the main chapel to the east. To the west, the main doors to the church have been solidly nailed shut, and through a shadowy doorway to the south you can see stairs leading down.  Piled in one dusty corner is a heap of old cloth.
Get cloth
You shake the cloth out, revealing it to be a hooded robe.  From the stairwell behind you there is a sudden, painful shriek of nails ripping out of stone, a loud, protracted splintering, and finally a thunderous crash that seems to echo up the shaft from far below.
East
Chapel Broken shards from the shattered the stained glass windows grits under your feet as you step around rows of overturned pews. The dust and cobwebs have been busy here, reclaiming another bit of this town's abandoned history. To the west lies the vestibule; to the east, a small doorway behind the pulpit leads to the back of the church.  The big wooden cross that once hung above the pulpit has fallen, split in half.  On the pulpit is a huge, black tome.
Read huge tome
It lies open atop the pulpit, thicker than an unabridged dictionary. Its thousands of yellowed, crinkly pages are bound in a strange black material that looks like some kind of hide but clearly isn't leather. Your first thought was that it might be a Bible, but a glance is sufficient to tell you otherwise. The text within is arranged in two columns, the first in what looks like Latin, the second a translation in English. There are illustrations, as well: horrible icons that make your skin crawl to look at.  As you lean closer over the pages to make out the words in this dim light, the letters seem to writhe and crawl across the page, twisting themselves into strange combinations, horrible words that you've never read before... and yet, somehow, you can understand their repulsive meaning. Something about a "Blessed Event",  which will happen very soon, and a hideous god whose name may not be spoken...  Is this the book that was preached in this church before it fell to ruin? Are these the gods these people worshipped? You want to tear your eyes from the page in revulsion, but some small, gleefully filthy part of you wants to keep reading, to uncover the secrets that the people of Anchorhead uncovered...  Will you read on?
East
You step away from the podium with a shudder.   Behind the Chapel This little room behind the chapel is hardly bigger than a broom closet. A ladder bolted to the wall leads up through a hatch, presumably up into the steeple.
Up
Steeple A tiny space inside the tip of the church's steeple, barely five feet across, the walls tapering to only two feet across some twelve feet above your head. There is a narrow window, but it seems to have been painted black at some point. The only exit seems to be the ladder from which you just emerged.  An old length of rope dangles down from a square hole cut in the ceiling.
Up
You haul yourself up onto the rope, bringing your whole weight to bear. It holds for about three seconds    then there is a sharp snap from above you and a muffled clank. The rope falls, spilling you to the floor amidst an untidy tangle of coils.
Get rope
You pick up the length of rope. It's about twenty feet long, frayed in a few places but still sturdy enough.

Broken Stairs The stairs are completely gone, now. All that's left is a narrow ledge overlooking an empty shaft, and a fair portion of the railing still nailed to the wall.
Drop robe in shaft
The hooded robe drops down out of sight, and a few seconds later you hear a faint splash.
Tie rope to railing
You tie the rope securely to the railing, letting the other end dangle down into the dark shaft.
Down
Gripping the end of the rope tightly, you lower yourself off the edge and shimmy down into the darkness.  Hanging From the Rope Your feet dangle over empty space. Looking down, you can barely make out a faint glimmer of water, far below.
Drop rope
You take a deep breath, shut your eyes tight, say a quick prayer... and let go of the rope.  The heart stopping plunge lasts only a second or two before you hit shockingly cold water. Your flashlight goes out and blackness envelopes you. Water rushes into your mouth and nose; the stone bottom slams into your side and nearly knocks the wind out of you... and then you find your feet, and your head breaks the surface. Blindly, you thrash about until you find higher ground, and you crawl, choking and sputtering, feeling cold brick beneath your fingers.  Darkness It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
Light flashlight
The flashlight must not be quite as waterproof as you originally thought; the beam flickers unsteadily, and you have to bang it against the palm of your hand a couple of times to get it to work.  Vaulted Tunnel The walls of this long, rectangular chamber are made of crumbling brick, not concrete; most likely it was built at some earlier period than the rest of the tunnels. The ceiling is lost in darkness above you, but from the sounds of the echoes it must be pretty high. Water flowing in from the northwestern tunnel has pooled in a depression sunk into the limestone floor, becoming quite deep near the far end.  The shattered wreckage of the church stairway lies half submerged in the water filled depression. You're lucky to have missed it in your fall.  You can also see a hooded robe and a lantern here.
Get robe

Taken.
NW
Sewer Tunnel The tunnel is ankle deep in brackish water, though raised walkways on either side provide relatively dry footing. The walls are slick, the air damp and foul. The main tunnel runs north and southeast. Numerous smaller pipelines lead in all directions, but all are too small for you to crawl through. Iron rungs embedded in the wall lead up through an access shaft, back to the surface.
North
Dripping Tunnel The ceiling in this north south tunnel is so low you must bend nearly double to navigate it. Water drips endlessly through the walls and ceiling, seeping in through thousands of invisible fissures, the constant plip plip plipping echoing loudly throughout the tunnel. The air is so damp you can hardly breathe. Unless your sense of direction is mistaken, you must be crossing the Miskaton River    underneath it.  The flashlight beam flickers uncertainly for a moment, then comes back a bit weaker than before.
North
Broken Tunnel This looks to be an older part of the sewer system that has fallen into disrepair. Many of the pipes here have crumbled and are filled with debris.  Set in the low ceiling is an old iron hatch.
Open tin
(first taking the old tin) You open the old tin, revealing a smelly quantity of fish oil.
Put oil on hatch
(first getting some fish oil) You dip your finger in and come up with a small glob of pungent fish oil.  You rub a good amount of fish oil all over the rusty hinges.
Open hatch
The oiled hinges give a little, allowing you to wiggle your fingers further under the door's edge. A sharp tug    and the door swings down suddenly, spilling filthy water into your face.
Up
Outflow Tunnel From the smell of it, this must be a sewage outflow tunnel. Filthy water swirls past a metal grate to the west and eddies around your hands and knees, on which you are forced to crawl in this cramped cylindrical passageway. To the east, the tunnel narrows still further, terminating about twenty feet further in a circle of dim light. Much of the water is pouring through an open hatch set in the floor of the tunnel.
East
You reach the end of the pipe and wriggle your way out, dropping awkwardly to the sand.  Narrow Beach This narrow strip of beach is tucked away between two outcroppings in the predominantly rocky shoreline, accessible only from a steep, muddy slope to the west. The sand is filthy and strewn with rocks, seaweed, litter and other bits of storm tossed detritus.  Near the bottom of the slope, a sewage outflow pipe juts out over the beach, about three feet above the ground. A thin stream of acrid smelling sewer water trickles out over the lip of the pipe, forming a puddle in the sand.
West
At the top of the slope you find a tall, wooden fence with a loose board near the bottom; pushing it aside, you manage to wriggle through the gap.  Alley This narrow aperture between two buildings is nearly blocked with piles of rotting cardboard boxes and overstuffed garbage cans. Ugly, half crumbling brick walls to either side totter oppressively over you. The alley ends here at a tall, wooden fence.  High up on the wall of the northern building there is a narrow, transom style window. One of the garbage cans has been pushed up against the wall directly underneath it.
NW
Outside the Real Estate Office A grim little cul de sac, tucked away in a corner of the claustrophobic tangle of narrow, twisting avenues that largely constitute the older portion of Anchorhead. Like most of the streets in this city, it is ancient, shadowy, and leads essentially nowhere. The lane ends here at the real estate agent's office, which lies to the east, and winds its way back toward the center of town to the west. A narrow, garbage choked alley opens to the southeast.  The office door is open.
East
Office Pallid gray light trickles in through the drawn blinds. The office is deserted, papers still scattered across the top of the desk. The front door lies west, and the file room lies east.  The office door is open.  Sitting on the corner of the paper strewn desk are a telephone and an answering machine.  Someone seems to have left a cup of coffee sitting out, half finished and cold.
Unlock drawer
(first taking the keyring) You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after several false attempts you discover that the small steel key fits the lock. You unlock the drawer.  The flashlight beam flickers uncertainly for a moment, then comes back a bit weaker than before.
Open drawer
You open the drawer, revealing a hastily written letter and a tarnished bronze key.  The flashlight beam flickers uncertainly for a moment, then comes back a bit weaker than before.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
Get all from drawer
tarnished bronze key: (slipping the lantern into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You remove the tarnished bronze key from the drawer. It is heavy and apparently very old, crusted over in places with a thin rime of verdigris. hastily written letter: (slipping the old tin into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) (closing the old tin first) You remove the hastily written letter from the drawer. It consists of several pages torn from a yellow legal pad and stapled in the corner; each page is covered on both sides, top to bottom, with erratic, frightened handwriting. It is dated two days ago    the day you arrived in Anchorhead.
Read letter
(the hastily written letter) The letter reads:  "To whom it may concern     "My name is Claudia Benson, and I attest that I am of sound mind and body, at least for what little time I have left.  "If you are reading this anywhere within the city limits of Anchorhead, be aware that your life is in grave and immediate danger. Nearly all of the inhabitants of this city are members of a secret cult that has thrived since before the first settlers arrived here in the early 1600s and is still strong today. Its members are fanatical and quite insane, and will kill anyone who learns their secrets. I received a phone call early this morning which I believe is a threat to my life; I assume the cult somehow discovered that I was planning to divulge information to an outsider and now plans to silence me. In case I don't make it, I am leaving this testimony for someone to find; hopefully it will be someone who can put a stop to this madness once and for all.  "The cult originally evolved from the rituals of the ancient Misquat Indian tribe that once lived in this region. Although this tribe is now extinct, its beliefs have been passed down relatively unchanged through generations of settlers for nearly four centuries. These beliefs center around the worship of some sort of demon or god from the outer reaches of space, which visited the earth millions of years ago and will return some day to wreak terrible destruction. I am unclear on the exact details as there is very little historical information available on this tribe, unless the University is hiding material from me, which I am half convinced it may well be.  "The ringleaders of this cult are and have always been the Verlac family. Every second generation a male Verlac is born, and the role of high priest is passed down from grandfather to grandson, following some arcane ritual of ascension. There is a persistent legend that this ritual somehow involves a transmigration of souls    that, in fact, all male Verlacs are actually the reincarnation of the original founder of the American line. Although this is obviously nothing more than local superstition, the legend has such a hold on the people of the region that it may have become a self perpetuating delusion on the part of the members of the Verlac family, each male child honestly believing that he is his own grandfather reborn. Edward Verlac rejected this obscene birthright, and I believe that the townspeople drove him to insanity for it.  "Regardless of the truth behind these legends, the cult is planning to act very soon. In the 1920s, Edward's grandfather Mordecai Verlac began preaching that the return of the 'Nameless God' was imminent    specifically, that it would occur the day after tomorrow. He re opened the defunct paper mill, converting it into a factory to build some sort of device, a 'beacon' with which to facilitate the Nameless God's entry into this world. This device is very nearly finished, and in two days they will be ready to enact their great ritual    what they call the 'Blessed Event'. It will most likely entail the wholesale slaughter of every non cultist man, woman and child in the city. The child abductions of the past few years were most likely preparatory sacrifices perpetrated by the cult, and there is no reason to believe that the killing will stop once their great ritual is complete.  "If you are, in fact, the young man who planned to move into the Verlac estate, you must be careful. The cult is almost certainly watching your every move, and will attempt to induct and brainwash you into their cult or, failing that, murder both you and your wife. I had hoped to warn you upon your arrival; however, as the message on my answering machine this morning attests, I don't have much time left. With any luck, I'll be out of the city by tonight. If I don't make it, please try to stop these people. This key might help    I managed to dig it out our old property file on the lighthouse. I know they consider that building important for some reason. Do what you can with it. And be careful. These cultists are a menace, inbred and insane to the last man, and no one will be safe until they are wiped off the face of the earth.  "Good luck, and be careful.           Claudia Benson"

The office door is open.
West
Narrow Street As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.  There appears to be a commotion of sorts to the south, where a group of townsfolk have gathered.
West
Junction To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.
North
Mill Road The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.
West
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and slightly more difficult to breathe.  Entrance to the Paper Mill The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.
North
Shanty Town The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.  Curtains twitch behind a grimy windowpane, and you glance over in time to see a lean, suspicious face pulling back into the shadows.
Knock on door 11
After a moment or two of silence, you hear a furtive rattling, and the door opens a crack to reveal a woman's pale and haggard face. She stares out you with a mixture of trepidation and mistrust.
Give teddy to woman
(first taking the teddy bear) The woman's eyes widen in sudden recognition, and she takes the teddy bear from you, turning it over to read the name stitched on the back. Tears well up in her eyes, spilling over onto her pale, sunken cheeks. "This is my boy's," she whispers. "This is Jeffrey's."  She looks at you suddenly. "Where did you find this? Did you find..." but then she stops. She can see from your face that you have not found her son, only this one clue. But... even one clue, however tenuous, offers possibility. And the woman's face softens, just a little bit, with something that you guess hasn't made its home there in a very, very, long time:  Hope.  "Come in," she says softly. "Thank you for bringing me this. Please, come in."  She steps aside from the door, and you enter her home.  #11 Mill Town Road A dirty, ramshackle home, scraped together out of the bits and ends of working class poverty. The floor is warped and broken wood, bare dirt showing through the cracks between boards. Rags hang across the window in lieu of curtains. Over in the far corner is a rickety old stove; in the opposite corner a threadbare cot; it hits you suddenly that a family of three once lived, slept and ate all in this single room, which is slightly smaller than your bedroom back at the house.  The woman watches you expectantly.  On the threadbare cot is a teddy bear.  A set of grime smeared overalls hangs on a hook next to the front door to the west.  Your score has just gone up by two points.

Entrance to the Paper Mill The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.
South
The path curves southwest, leading you into an overgrown area behind the mill.  Bare Foundations The foundations of an older structure lie crumbling in a sunken square of ground, hidden away behind the imposing shadow of the mill wall. Weeds push up through cracked and buckling slabs of concrete; twisted rebar and rusting pipes poke up like the legs of dead insects. The ruins are surrounded on all sides by dense thickets, although narrow, overgrown trails lead northeast and southeast through the underbrush.  A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in the wind.
Search thicket
Carefully pushing the prickly branches aside, you find a rusty metal hatch set into the base of the wall.
Unlock hatch
You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after several false attempts you discover that the long steel key fits the lock. You unlock the metal hatch.  The cold wind blows harder, tugging at the hem of your trenchcoat.

Taken.  A gust of wind blows your hair into your face.
North
(opening the metal hatch first)  Darkness It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.  The noise of machinery is growing steadily louder.
Light match
(first taking the book of matches) (slipping the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) Taken. One of the matches starts to burn.  The machines behind the walls are reaching a feverish pitch, and an unpleasant vibration ripples up and down the crawlway.  Maintenance Access Tunnel You are at the southern end of a long, narrow crawlway leading northward into the mill. All around you, through the metallic walls, you can hear the oppressive thumping and grinding of heavy machinery. The air in here is hot and smells of burnt engine oil.  A large metal valve wheel juts out from the middle of one of the many fat, sweating pipes lining the walls. Just to its left is a gauge of some sort.
Light lantern
The lantern is now lit.  Just as the mechanical noises reach a crescendo, the pipes at the north end of the crawlway suddenly give vent to an enormous gout of superheated steam. The entire north half of the crawlway is momentarily filled with vapor and intense heat, which just as quickly dissipates. The noise behind the walls recedes to a calmer level, and the needle on the gauge swings back down to zero.
Put towel on valve
(first taking the towel) (slipping the hastily written letter into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You drape the towel over the valve wheel.  Ouch! You drop the match as it burns down to your fingers.
Turn wheel
You grip the sides of the wheel    even through the towel, you can feel the heat radiating from it    and haul it clockwise with all your strength. It squeaks reluctantly at first, then gives all at once. From down the corridor you hear an enormous hissing rush as steam is vented from the pipes, and the needle in the gauge drops abruptly down to zero.  Your score has just gone up by one point.

North
(opening the hatch first) With a sharp tug, the heavy metal door swings open.  Mill Floor Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever churning inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get up there from here.  A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet pooled on the floor next to a bank of controls.
Tie chain to me
You wrap the chain around your waist a few times.
Look at controls
The waist high bank has all number of arcane lights, dials and gauges on it; however, the only two controls that bear mentioning are a lever and a large red button.
Pull lever
You feel something click as the lever activates a hidden releasing mechanism; then, suddenly, the chain pulls taut and jerks you off your feet, hauling you up through the air    narrowly missing a piece of heavy equipment sailing past you on its way down    all the way up to the catwalk, where the chain slows and finally stops, depositing you safely, though left somewhat breathless, on the grilled surface.  Catwalk The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the machines beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what looks like a wide balcony with several large banks of equipment.  A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet wrapped securely around your waist.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
Untie chain
You disentangle yourself from the chain.
North
Workshop Several workbenches and racks of arcane electronic equipment have been dragged together to form a sort of open laboratory on this wide balcony overlooking the mill. A wide table dominates the area, strewn with precision tools, bits of wire, and scribbled calculations. To the south, a narrow catwalk hangs above the mill floor, and a metal ladder leads down into the machinery below.  Prominent among the strange tools scattered across the table is a strange caliper like instrument.  On the workbenches are some notes and some arcane electronic equipment.  One of the racks contains a number of circular mirrors, stacked side by side like dishes in a dishwasher.  Tacked up on the wall is a large technical blueprint.
Read notes
The notes are a mess of incomprehensibly scrawled numbers; long printouts of technical data, tangled diagrams and complex formulae. Even if you had the slightest idea what all the calculations meant, the numbers are barely even legible.  Lifting up a sheet of cribbed equations, you notice what looks to be a general memo to all mill workers.
Get caliper
You pick up the calipers. Made of stainless steel, molded in a strangely flowing, almost organic design, the calipers    if that is what they are    resemble no other tool you've ever seen. It has three independently adjustable arms, each ending in a needle point pincer, which fold back on themselves at grotesque, asymetrical angles toward a floating center point. There is a calibrated readout set near the base, which presumably provides a measure of whatever strange contortion of space is occupied by whatever object is placed between the pincers at the tool's other end.
Get memo
(slipping the book of matches into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the printed memo. It's a flimsy sheet of paper with the following message printed on it:  !!NOTICE TO ALL BRETHREN!! The focusing mirrors must be kept absolutely clean at ALL TIMES. Even the slightest smudge of dirt or grease can create dangerous instabilities in the refraction patterns.  All mirrors must receive ionization treatment as a matter of course. As an extra precaution, however, always use sterilized surgical gloves when handling them.  In the Name of He Who Is Named Not, the Mgt.
Get Blueprint
(slipping the calipers into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) The blueprint curls up into a loose tube as you pull it from the wall.
Read blueprint
You spread out the rolled up blueprint to look it over.  The blueprint is a technical schematic for some extremely complicated device, the exact purpose of which is anything but clear. It looks a bit like a telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out, and a bit like the "industrial laser" from Goldfinger. The inner workings of the device involve a complicated arrangement of lenses and mirrors and a hopeless tangle of circuitry that vaguely resembles several dozen street maps of Manhattan laid across each other. Some of the notations on the circuitry don't even look like technical symbols; they look more like cabbalistic runes.  Next to what must represent the main focusing mirror of the device, someone has written the number "0.0113"; someone else, in another handwriting, has scratched that number out and written below it, "0.0120".
Get mirror 1
(slipping the printed memo into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the mirror labeled #1. The mirror is perfectly round and exquisitely polished. It is very slightly concave on its reflecting surface, distorting the edges of your face as you stare into it. On the back is a small label with the number 1 written on it.
Put mirror 1 in caliper
The instrument holds the mirror delicately clamped between its pincers; the readout reads "0.0120".
Open tin
(first taking the old tin) (slipping the blueprint into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) Taken. You open the old tin, revealing a smelly quantity of fish oil.
Rub oil on mirror 1
(first getting some fish oil) You dip your finger in and come up with a small glob of pungent fish oil.  You rub a small bit of fish oil onto the reflective surface of the mirror, leaving a barely perceptible smear.
South
Catwalk The catwalk stretches north, a narrow ribbon of metal grillwork dangling fifty feet over the factory floor and shuddering dangerously in time with the machines beneath it. There are no railings of any kind. At the far end you can see what looks like a wide balcony with several large banks of equipment.  A long chain dangles from overhead, its last few feet dangling in the air just beyond the edge of the catwalk. Its other end is looped over a pulley system up in the ceiling, and continues all the way down, past the catwalk, to the floor.
Down
You slide down the chain, landing awkwardly on the large block of heavy equipment at the bottom.  Mill Floor, on the block of heavy equipment Waves of heat and noise assault you from every corner. Towering above you on all sides are the enormous vats, presses and sundry machinery, the ever churning inner workings of the paper mill. An opening in the base of the south wall leads back to the maintenance crawlway, and narrow aisles lead in several other directions through the chugging machinery. A grilled catwalk high over your head provides a more direct route across the factory; however, you see no way to get up there from here.

To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.
East
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more breathable once again.  Mill Road The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.  A distant flicker of movement draws your eyes to the faraway lighthouse. A lone figure, tiny in the distance, makes its way stealthily around the small spur of rock at the end of the breakwater and slips inside the door at the tower's base. It's impossible to see the person's face from this distance, but the hair, the way he walks... you'd swear it was Michael.
East
The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.  Breakwater You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.
NE
At the Foot of the Lighthouse You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.  The great bronze door of the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, revealing a narrow rectangle of blackness within.
East
Bottom of the Lighthouse The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.
Up
You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.  Top of the Lighthouse The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast, undulating blanket.  Sitting in the middle of the room is what looks like a swivel mount of some kind, although nothing is mounted on it now. Looking up, you see that it rests directly below a large, hexagonal skylight.
Down
You hastily descend the winding steps to the bottom.  Bottom of the Lighthouse The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.  There is a faint scuffing noise from the shadows behind you    before you can turn around, something slams into the back of your head with brutal force. Sparks go off in front of your eyes, and you fall to the cool concrete floor with the world reeling under you. As you kneel there, dazed and struggling not to pass out, your assailant walks slowly around you. He pauses, as if wondering whether or not to finish you off.  Terror and nausea wash over you in alternating waves. You are too weak to look up and see his face, but you recognize his shoes easily enough. After all, you helped him pick them out not three weeks ago.  More footsteps come down the stairs, and you sense a number of men standing around you. "We'll take care of her, Your Holiness," rasps an old, weathered voice. Rough hands start to drag you to your feet.  "No," says Michael, and the hands pause.  "Your Holiness, she has seen too much," protests the raspy voice. "She must be killed."  "That won't be necessary," Michael says. "Put her somewhere out of the way, where she can't get into any more trouble. I'll deal with her myself... after the Blessed Event."  The horror and pain are too much; the darkness overwhelms you. You try to catch a glimpse of your husband's face as the men drag you away, but in your clouding vision all you can see are a pair of burning, red rimmed eyes...

We                                           live on a placid island of ignorance in                                           the midst of black seas of infinity,                                           and it was not meant that we should                                           voyage far... but some day the piecing                                           together of dissociated knowledge will                                           open up such terrifying vistas of                                           reality, and of our frightful position                                           therein, that we shall either go mad                                           from the revelation or flee from the                                           deadly light into the peace and safety                                           of a new dark age.

Numb.  You float slowly to consciousness like a bubble rising to the surface of some warm, thick oil. You are numb.  For several minutes, that is as much as your battered mind can handle, that one thought: you are numb.  Then your head becomes a bit clearer, and you connect the thought with the sensations trying to make their way through your foggy brain. You are numb. Your arms. You can't feel your arms at all.  You try to get up but you can't move; you merely flop over onto your stomach like a struggling worm. You roll back over and sit up, and at last your vision clears and you finally get a good look around, and the horror of your situation finally slams home...  Padded Cell You are in a padded cell, the kind typically reserved for raving lunatics. The room is barely eight feet by eight feet square, with walls and floor of concrete covered with thick, quilted padding. The door in the west wall is also covered with padding, except for a tiny observation window about five feet up, from which a feeble light trickles in.
Break door
You take a few steps back, draw a deep breath, and hurl your body at the door. It shudders violently, and you thought you felt something give.
Break door
With a defiant shout, you launch your body at the door. Something snaps (the door? you think incoherently, or your shoulder?), and the door flies open, sending you sprawling out into the hallway.  Hallway A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the north end; the hallway runs south from here. Doors lead east and west, and a narrow, barred window to the north looks out onto the dark corner outside.  A shard of glass from the broken window lies on the floor.
Get glass
(the shard of glass) Painstakingly, you get down on your knees and very, very carefully pick up the shard of glass with your teeth.
Look at window pane
Building maintenance is obviously not a big priority at this institution. The wall around the window casement is cracked in several places    some of the cracks are quite large. The window pane itself is broken in, probably by a misguided bird sometime in the recent past.
Put glass in crack
(the shard of glass in the crack) You wedge the shard of glass into the crack, its sharp edge pointing outward.
Cut jacket with glass
(the shard of glass) Carefully, you lean back against the wall and start shrugging your shoulders against the jutting glass shard. After what seems like an eternity, you feel the straps begin to fray and loosen, until suddenly the strait jacket grows slack and slips free. You shake the horrible garment off in disgust, giving it a vicious kick for good measure as you gingerly rub feeling back into your arms.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
Open closet
You open the closet, revealing your trenchcoat, a hooded robe, a lantern, the mirror labeled #1 and an old tin.  A sudden flash of lightning from outside momentarily etches the room in sharp black and white contrast.
Wear coat
(first taking the trenchcoat) You put on the trenchcoat.         ka WHAM!!!      A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.
Get all from closet
hooded robe: You remove the hooded robe from the closet. lantern: You remove the lantern from the closet. mirror labeled #1: You remove the mirror labeled #1 from the closet. old tin: You remove the old tin from the closet.

Hallway A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the south end; the hall runs north from here. Doors lead east and west, and a doorway to the south leads to the top of a stairway.  Something about the observation window in the western cell door catches your eye; it looks like it has blood on it.

You unlock the west cell door.
Open west door
You open the west cell door.
West
Padded Cell Another padded cell, much like the rest. There is a door in the east wall.  The padding in this room seems a bit worse for the wear; murky bloodstains spatter the canvas near the door, and there is a large tear down in the corner of the cell, with bits of stuffing leaking out.
Look in tear
In the ragged tear is a torn square of canvas.
Get torn square
(slipping the lantern into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) As you carefully pull the ragged piece of canvas from its hiding place, something pricks you sharply on the finger. You jerk your hand away; then, peering into the tear once again, you notice an old, crusted needle embedded in the stuffing.  An eerie, flickering glow momentarily illuminates the hall outside the cell.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
Read torn square
It's roughly six inches to a side and covered front and back with uneven, barely legible handwriting. The letters are the murky brown color of blood.  "My name is Edward Verlac, and this is my testament:  "I am utterly, utterly mad.  "They have locked me in here for my own safety    and for the safety of others. My arms are bound in a strait jacket. Yet this is no less than I deserve. I am writing this using a needle dropped carelessly by one of the orderlies some weeks ago; biting my lip to draw blood for the ink, I hold the tiny steel quill beneath my teeth to write. This exhaustive task shall be my last on earth; when I am finished, I shall dash my brains out against the cell window. The last of the Verlacs will be dead, and the world made a slightly brighter place thereby.  "Know this: I did not slip into madness through any weakness or congenital defect (except insofar as my blood is indelibly tainted with the cursed ichor of the Verlac line)    I was driven mad by the spectre of my great great ancestor, Croseus Verlac. For generations that fiend has traveled down the family line, passing from body to body in a hideous, incestuous ritual whereby he impregnates his own daughter, then projects his black soul into the innocent body of his infant grandson. I myself was horrified to discover that I am in fact the progeny of my own grandfather, Mordecai Verlac, and his wretched, tormented daughter    my mother, Anna. The experiment failed on the first attempt, producing William, my sickly, malformed elder brother whom I never knew. William, however, died while still a toddler    or so my mother has always told me    and the next unholy coupling resulted in me.  "From as early as I can remember, I could feel the lurking presence of my grandfather, who died the day I was born, and who I now realize was little more than a fleshly disguise for the pernicious warlock Croseus. He stalked the boundaries of my mind, seeking a means of entrance, of condemning my soul to limbo and taking up a fresh, new abode in my young limbs. His evil, red rimmed eyes haunted my every dream and o'ershadowed even my waking hours. The amulet my mother gave me while I was still in the crib protected me    for the old man cannot abide its presence, and must flee all who wear it    but Mother died while I was still young, and since then my folly has brought tragedy to myself and to all those I love.  "The memory of my mother's urgent warnings faded soon after her death. I became embarrassed by the scandal that seemed to hover over my family name like a pall, and was mortified by the superstitious trinket that I still wore around my neck, as if in ignorant servitude to those old myths. The red rimmed eyes had not given me nightmares since my twelfth birthday, and I dismissed them as an immature fancy that had passed along with my boyhood. At the age of 21, I pawned the amulet at a magic shop somewhere in town, and thereby sealed my doom.  "For ten years I have resisted Croseus' demonic encroachment upon my mind, my soul, my very being, with only the strength of my will. It was not enough. I found my mind flooded at the oddest times with strange, antiquarian memories; my speech and mannerisms lapsed into uncharacteristic, archaic patterns; and worst of all, I found myself looking at my dear daughter Gertrude    only seven years old!    in the most unwholesome way, with the most unmentionable ideas creeping through my subconscious.  "I scoured every street in this cursed town, looking for that magic shop, but I have never found it. In desperation I began delving into old histories and forbidden genealogies, researching the history of the dread Verlac name for some solution to my plight. I discovered no answers, only the horrors I have just written of. But I also discovered something worse    the ultimate purpose behind the old demon's nefarious bodysnatching!  "He plans to unleash a primordial evil such that the earth could not possibly survive. I have seen the plans and the blueprints; I have read the dread tome in my great great grandfather's church; I have used the obsidian lens that is not true obsidian, and I have looked upon what that madman means to draw down onto this earth! He and this town, his foul congregation of fanatics and madmen! They are all a part of it! They have been watching me, waiting for me to change, waiting for the return of their monstrous high priest!!  "It was then that I realized that killing only myself would not be enough; for the degenerate inhabitants of this town would hunt down my family and wreak a terrible vengeance if I took from them their Messiah. And besides; who could say whether the crafty devil Croseus might not concoct some new way to enter the world, through a new body    through that of one of my daughters, perhaps? The ritual has always demanded a grandson, but Croseus was never one to let such a trivial inconvenience stop him. He would find a way. He always returns to his blood.  "I did the only thing I could do    Julia, I am so terribly sorry, but I will be with you soon    I could not let him have you, or Gertrude or Sonia    and I will not let him have me. Say good bye to the last of the Verlacs    there will be no blood for him once I am gone."         ka WHAM!!!      A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.
Get needle
(slipping the mirror labeled #1 into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You pick up the crusty needle. It's about two inches long, very old and crusted with what looks like dried blood. The point is worn down but still sharp.
East
Hallway A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the south end; the hall runs north from here. Doors lead east and west, and a doorway to the south leads to the top of a stairway.  Something about the observation window in the western cell door catches your eye; it looks like it has blood on it.
South
You are stopped halfway to the stairs by a loud banging noise behind you.  You turn around    there it is again. A loud, shuddering bang, like something heavy slamming into something wooden    and you see a cell door halfway down the hall shiver in its frame.  Looks like someone else is trying out your brilliant escape plan.  The door is hit a third time, the latch snaps and the door flies open, and a filthy, ragged man staggers out into the hall. You have just enough time to notice    with no small amount of disquiet    that the man is not wearing a strait jacket, and then he looks up at you and grins an utterly psychotic grin.  The madman hops awkwardly toward you, giggling and dripping saliva from his blood smeared chin.
South
Top of Stairs You are at the top of a stairwell leading down to the asylum's ground floor. A hallway lined with doors leads north.  The madman hops awkwardly toward you, giggling and dripping saliva from his blood smeared chin.
Down
Bottom of Stairs You are at the bottom of a stairwell leading up to the asylum's second floor. A hallway leads north.  The madman hops awkwardly toward you, giggling and dripping saliva from his blood smeared chin.
Get lantern
(slipping the old tin into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) (closing the old tin first) Taken.
Light match
(first taking the book of matches) (slipping the torn square of canvas into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) Taken. One of the matches starts to burn.
Light lantern
The lantern is now lit.  The fluorescent light above your head flickers eerily, casting the stairwell into momentary shadow.
North
Hallway A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. This is the south end; the hall runs north from here. A doorway to the south leads to the bottom of a stairway.  The madman follows you at a wary distance.  Ouch! You drop the match as it burns down to your fingers.
North
Hallway A grim hallway of concrete and industrial green tiles. The hallway runs south from here; to the north, the hallway ends at the barred gate leading to the lobby.  The orderly is lying face down in a pool of blood, several feet beyond the barred gate.  The orderly's porno magazine lies discarded on the floor, just outside the barred gate.  A large key dangles from the orderly's belt.  The madman lurches after you.
Get magazine
(slipping the crusty needle into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) You reach through the bars and snag the magazine.
Give magazine to madman
The madman snatches the magazine from your hand and begins pawing through it like an over sexed adolescent, giggling and occasionally squeezing his crotch.         ka WHAM!!!      A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.
Get large key
You pick up the cell key. Presumably, it opens the barred gates, providing access into (or out of) the asylum.  The madman giggles maniacally to himself, flipping through the pages of the magazine and drooling uncontrollably.
Put large key on keyring
The cell key is now on the keyring.
Unlock gate
(first taking the keyring) You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after several false attempts you discover that the cell key fits the lock. You unlock the barred gate.
North
The madman, noticing you trying to sneak off, tosses the magazine aside and hobbles after you. (opening the barred gate first)  Waiting Room Ugly, mint green tiles and walls of whitewashed cinderblock comprise the decor of this inhospitable waiting room. A hard little sofa upholstered in avocado vinyl and a feebly struggling potted palm are provided for the comfort of visitors, although you get the feeling that few inmates of this institution are fortunate enough to have visitors. A metal gate bars entrance to a southern passageway, which you assume leads to the inmates' section. The exit lies north.  The orderly is lying face down in a pool of blood in the middle of the room.  The orderly's name tag lies on the floor nearby.  The madman follows you at a wary distance.  The madman stops, stoops down, and picks a bit of gristly stuff out of the back of the orderly's head. He pops it into his mouth and chews it rapidly, rubbing his belly.
North
The rain is still coming down, so you open your umbrella. (first taking the umbrella) (slipping the book of matches into the pocket of your trenchcoat to get a hand free) Taken.  Asylum Courtyard The grim, white washed edifice of Danvers Asylum bounds this tiny, shadowed courtyard to the south, its narrow, barred windows staring blankly down at you like ranks of shriveled, empty eye sockets. You can escape through a narrow gateway in the high, brick wall to the north.  The madman comes prancing out the front door of the asylum, and suddenly stops dead in his tracks. He looks around, utterly dumbfounded. He looks up at the sky, and feels the raindrops striking his face. Slowly it dawns on his addled brain that he is outside; that he is, in fact, free.  With a wild whoop of pure joy, the madman hobbles away down the street, laughing and chattering to himself with such unabashed happiness that for a moment you almost forget that you have just let loose a dangerous and quite probably homicidal psychotic into the world at large.  Then again, you think, in this town he might just fit right in.  A sudden gust of rain puts the lantern out.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
North
Dark Corner The rooftops above you lean so close together as to nearly block out the sky altogether, making this a particularly dark and unpleasant section of the city. The street leads away to the east, and a shadowy driveway leads through a high brick wall to the south.
Remove coat
You take off the trenchcoat.
Wear robe
You put on the hooded robe.
East
Town Square A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.  In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.  As you step into the open square you hear a sudden commotion    several crowds of people are converging onto the town square from different directions. You can hear their shouts and see the flickering glow of their torches as the mob begins to swarm in from the north and east.
Wait
Time passes.  The obelisk glows red with the bloody light of their torches. They are almost here; you'd better find somewhere to hide, quickly.  A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie, green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.
wait
Time passes.  Robed men brandishing torches pour into the square, rallying around the obelisk at its center. Several of them seem to be struggling with someone. You huddle back into the shadows, but  no one seems to notice yet another robed figure in the midst of the crowd. For the moment, it seems, you are safe.         ka WHAM!!!      A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.
wait
You wait, helplessly.  The struggling men step forward, and you can see they have the old bum from the vacant lot. His wrists are bound and his arms held by two cultists on either side. Although he screams and writhes with frantic desperation, the frail old drunkard is no match for his captors. Someone raises his hands for silence    you can't quite see him from where you are    and the mob quiets down. Even the old bum's screams lower to a fearful whimpering.
wait
You wait, helplessly.  "My brethren," intones the leader, "we are gathered here to mete out bloody justice upon one who has sinned against us. This one,"    he jabs a finger at the old bum    "has divulged our secrets to an outsider and betrayed the sacred trust of our brotherhood! For this, his soul must be condemned forever, embraced and encysted within the necrotic folds of the Womb of Nehilim!"  At this, the crowd lets loose with a roar of approval, while the old bum throws back his head and shrieks helplessly into the storm.  The old man wails pitifully, begging his captors for mercy.
wait
You wait, helplessly.  The cultists drag the bum over to the monument and prepare to lift him up. Suddenly, he makes a break for it, bolting through the pressing crowd and running, by some grotesque twist of luck, straight at you.  The old man stops short. The flickering torchlight illuminates your face, and his eyes widen in recognition. He opens his mouth to speak...  And four burly cultists tackle him simultaneously, pulling him down. As the old man's body hits the ground, a small, shiny object falls out of the bum's clothes and bounces out across the cobblestones, unnoticed by all.  The cultists carry the bum back and lift him up onto the monument, hanging him by the wrists from the iron ring set into its tip.
Look
Town Square A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.  Your amulet is lying on the cobblestones a few yards away from the obelisk. Apparently, it didn't give the old bum as much luck as he'd hoped.  The square is packed with an angry, screaming mob of cultists.  In the center of the square, rising from a circular lawn of unhealthy looking grass and weeds, stands a strange, stone obelisk. It seems to be a monument of some sort, although you can see no plaque or marker anywhere near it.  "Please," sobs the old man pitifully, "please, I didn't, I swear, I didn't tell nobody nothing, so I didn't! I SWEAR TO GOD I DIDN'T TELL    "  Before the poor old man can finish his plea, a dozen cultists brandishing long metal rods begin brutally beating him. You avert your eyes; his screams are quickly cut off as his ribs are staved in, and soon all you can hear are the horrible thuds, and the wet snapping sound of breaking bones.
Put all in pocket
umbrella: (closing the umbrella first) You slip the umbrella into the pocket of your trenchcoat. keyring: You slip the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat. lantern: You slip the lantern into the pocket of your trenchcoat.  Although it seems to go on forever, the slaughter is finished in less than a minute. The crowd backs away, its cheering and chanting diminished to a low, hypnotic murmur. The cultists quickly disperse back into the streets, and within moments the square is once again empty... except for the mutilated thing hanging from the obelisk.
Get amulet
You pick up the amulet, musing sadly that it must not have brought the poor old bum as much luck as he'd hoped.  A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie, green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.  The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
North
Whateley Bridge A hoary monument of crumbling, moss eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.  As you approach the bridge, you see a hulking shadow lurking about on the far bank. You slow down warily, remembering the townsfolk who threatened you earlier, peering through the darkness and obscuring rain to catch a glimpse of the person. Then the figure moves slightly, and you realize that it's much larger than a man; in fact, the figure isn't shaped anything like a man at all.  A sudden crack of lightning illuminates the bridge for a brief, horrible instant    and in that instant, you see it.  In the next few moments, your battered mind manages to blot out the memory of that bloated, barrel like, armless trunk; those thick, double jointed legs that end in shiny black hooves; that writhing forest of fleshy tendrils crowning the torso in place of a proper head    but you are not, and will never be, able to banish the horrible, searing memory of the thing's misplaced face which leers madly out at you from the side of the trunk    that child's face on a monster's body!         ka WHAM!!!      A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.  The creature lurches toward you, its hooved feet thumping heavily on the old stone bridge.
Give gold locket to creature
(first taking the gold locket) You toss the gold locket at the monster's feet, and the clasp springs open when it hits the cobblestones, revealing the woman's portrait inside. The creature looks down and is immediately captivated. It bends over awkwardly, delicately grasps the chain with the tip of one tentacle, and holds the locket up to its face.  For a single heartbeat of time, even the storm seems to hold still. The little boy's face gazes at the picture in the locket for a long, aching moment. And a silent tear wells up in the corner of its eye and trickles down its cheek.  The monster ignores you for the moment, fascinated by the portrait of its mother.
Hit creature with hook
(first taking the meat hook) With a hoarse yell of desperation, you raise the meat hook over your head and fly at the monster while its attention is absorbed by the tiny picture of its mother.  It never even sees you coming. With brutal accuracy, you sink the meat hook deep into the left eye of the little boy's face. It screams, a high, squawling wail like a frightened infant, and a thick, black ichor spurts from the wound. It thrashes about helplessly, knocking you onto the ground, and you scramble back on your hands and feet crab style, trying to get away from its struggles.  Another flash of lightning, and you see the thing stagger over to the side of the bridge. One tentacle manages to pluck out the hook, which clatters to the pavement    but the damage has been done. The monster hits the stone parapet, overbalances, and goes over the side, taking the locket with it. It hits the water with a giant splash and is instantly engulfed by the raging current. By the time you get to your feet, rush to the side and look over, the monster's body is gone.  Your score has just gone up by two points.
North
Narrow Street As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.
West
Junction To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.
North
Mill Road The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.  A group of cultists passes you, heading north from the town.  A sizzling bolt of lightning cuts through the night sky, illuminating your surroundings in a sudden sheet of blinding white radiance that leaves eerie, green afterimages scarred onto your retinas.  The cultists, thinking you are one of their own, pass by silently.
East
The road heads out over a narrow breakwater jutting out into the ocean.  Breakwater You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.  The sea thrashes against the shore with storm driven fury.         ka WHAM!!!      A monstrous clap of thunder rolls across the sky, shaking the whole town to its foundations.
NE
At the Foot of the Lighthouse You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.  The sea thrashes against the shore with storm driven fury.  The great bronze door of the lighthouse is closed.  A flurry of dead leaves goes skittering along the ground, swirling past you in the wind.
Unlock door
(first taking the keyring) You go through all the keys on your keyring, trying each one in turn, and after several false attempts you discover that the tarnished bronze key fits the lock. You unlock the massive bronze door.  Another wave crashes against the rocks, sending a cloud of spray into the air.
Open door
With great effort, you manage to pull the ancient, creaking door open a few inches, enough to slip through.  The clouds overhead mutter restlessly to themselves.
East
Bottom of the Lighthouse The sound of the ocean is muffled behind the thick cinderblock walls, and the air is damp and heavy. You can almost feel the weight of two hundred feet of hoary old whitewashed brick pressing down on you from above. To the west, a narrow strip of dim light marks the exit. Cracked concrete steps lead up.
Up
You climb the winding stairs in a gradual spiral around the inner circumference of the tower, and finally emerge, breathless, at the top.  Top of the Lighthouse The stairs give onto a wide, circular chamber surrounded by windows. The glass is old and streaked with grime, but you still have to catch your breath at the magnificence of the view. In one direction, the dying heath and the stunted cluster of buildings that is Anchorhead; in the other, the ocean like a vast, undulating blanket.  Sitting in the middle of the room, beneath a large, hexagonal skylight, is the most bizarre, incomprehensibly complicated device you have ever seen.
Look at device
It looks a bit like a telescope, a bit like a microwave oven turned inside out, and a bit like the "industrial laser" from Goldfinger. It's pointed almost straight up, right through the skylight, aimed directly at the rumbling hole in the sky. Its exact purpose is unfathomable, but it is emitting an ominous, throbbing hum and radiating a curious warmth that causes an unwholesome prickling sensation all over your skin.  Most of the exposed components are too complex to comprehend, but there is a receptacle about two thirds of the way along the thing's    er, "barrel"    that contains a round mirror, like a focusing mirror in a telescope. It looks as though you could remove it.

The receptacle lets go of the mirror with a metallic click and a pneumatic hiss.  "Well, well; if it isn't the loyal wife."  You whirl around to find Michael standing in the doorway, flanked by two robed guards who stare at you with a distinct glitter of malice in their eyes.
put all in pocket
real mirror: You slip the real mirror into the pocket of your trenchcoat. keyring: You slip the keyring into the pocket of your trenchcoat. amulet: You slip the amulet into the pocket of your trenchcoat.  Michael smirks as he advances on you. "You're quite a persistent little tart, aren't you? Quite the gutsy little irritant. I suppose Michael must have been one of those 'modern' men; didn't go in for the submissive type." Michael    or whatever fiend is speaking from behind Michael's face    sneers. "Didn't have the balls for it, is my guess. In my day, we knew how to keep our wives. A headstrong woman should be broken in, just like a headstrong horse."
Wait
Time passes.  Michael walks past you and runs his fingers along the strange device.  "My, my, you do keep busy," Michael remarks when he finds the focusing mirror missing. "It's a good thing I caught you in time." He turns to you and holds out his hand. "Your little game is over now, woman, and you've lost. Give me the mirror now."
Give mirror 1 to Michael
(first taking the mirror labeled #1) "That's more like it," Michael says.  Michael pauses, glances down at the mirror in his hand, then smirks at you. "But of course, there's no telling where else you've been poking around, what you might have gotten your dirty little hands on, hmm?"  He leans in close to you, and you can smell corruption on his breath like rotting oranges. "I've been wondering where this had gotten off to," he murmurs in your ear, taking the caliper like instrument from you. He applies the instrument to the mirror, and frowns as he checks the readout.  Then he smiles.  "Well, that's that then," he says, placing the mirror back in its receptacle. He nods toward the guards, who seize you and begin dragging you down the stairs.  "It's time to clue you in to just what's been going on around here," Michael says, following behind you. "First hand. I think you'll find it quite... enthralling."  You are dragged bodily down to the foot of the lighthouse and around to the rocky outcropping, where an island of flesh floats just beyond the breakwater's tip. The guards shove their way through the crowds of robed supplicants, carrying you to the island's center. They force you to your knees and, despite your best efforts at escape, manhandle you into a pair of handcuffs looped through an iron ring set in a heavy stone block. The block is so low, you are forced to remain kneeling in the squelchy muck, craning your neck to watch the orgiastic ceremoney taking place... and your husband    no, you tell yourself, not your husband; the creature that your husband has become    leading the terrible rites.  Island of Flesh The island is barely forty feet across, its surface covered with an ankle deep layer of slime and muck. Underneath the muck, the ground throbs    heaving rhythmically to a blasphemous, living pulse.  The sea thrashes against the shore with storm driven fury.  The robed guards hover to either side of you, waiting for you to make a move.  Michael stands in the center of it all, leading the hellish rites.  Robed cultists crowd around on every side    some of them brandishing flaming torches, some of them chanting in some hideous, archaic tongue, all of them swaying to the hypnotic pulse that rises up from the depths of the fleshy ground.  You are handcuffed to one of several heavy stone blocks set in a rough semicircle around the center of the island.  Lashed to a stake in the center of the island is a young boy.
Wait
You wait, helplessly.
Wait
You wait, helplessly.  Michael takes up a torch from one of the crowd. Holding it high above his head, he turns to the lighthouse and intones:  "Iach! That Which May Not Be Named, I call upon Thee! Formless Drifter of the Gulfs Between, I summon Thee!"  The crowd murmurs in ecstatic encouragement.
Wait
You wait, helplessly.  "I cast aside the Seals! I throw open the Gates!"  Michael traces a mystic sigil in the air in front of him with the flaming torch. The flames seem to hang for a moment in strange patterns before twisting away into nothing.  "OHODOS   SCIES   ABYSSON!"  The torch flares up with a roar, and the ocean waves seem to respond with sudden, inexplicable fury, crashing brutally against the island.
Wait
You wait, helplessly.  Michael turns his back on the lighthouse, facing out to sea.  "To the East, where the Spawning Chaos seethes and suppurates within the Crucible of Grum, from whose bursting pustules arise the Million Unseeable Forms, I summon Thee!"
Wait
You wait, helplessly.  Michael makes a quarter turn to his left.  "To the North, where the Howling Hunger sweeps invisibly across the Yellow Plains and gnaws upon the entrails of the pious, I summon Thee!"  A monstrous bolt of lightning licks down from the sky and strikes the sea just north of the island, sending a spume of steam and boiling water fifty feet into the shrieking sky. Screams of fear and rapture erupt throughout the pressing crowd, almost inaudible beneath the deafening peal of thunder.
Wait
You wait, helplessly.  Michael isn't even fazed. He makes a half turn to the right and continues:  "To the South, where the Seven Corpulent Sultans of Slaas'tha stand in judgment over the Heretics of Kron, and force their vile copulations upon the repentant, I summon Thee!"  Another lightning bolt, this time striking just south of the island, and another spume of water. The crowd begins to writhe and gibber madly, like a single, plasmic organism.
Wait
You wait, helplessly.  Michael makes a three quarter turn to his left, coming all the way around to face the lighthouse once more.  "To the Ultimate West, wherein lies the Void That Conquers All, I summon Thee!"  The top of the lighthouse begins to glow with an unwholesome, violet light. A low, ominous vibration creeps up from the ground, crawling up through your bones and reverberating painfully in your teeth.
Wait
You wait, helplessly.  The air around the lighthouse is rippling now. Several cultists fall convulsing to the mud; others are screaming in strange, strangled tongues. The earth shakes, and the air is split by a high pitched harmonic ringing, like a crystal about to shatter.  Michael raises the torch, preparing to thrust it into the pyre at the child's feet. He throws his head back and shrieks directly into the eye of the storm:  "IACH! PIOTH XENOBETHAKLES! ULUTUK FH'TAGHN!! BY THE KEYS OF IOK SOTOT I NAME THEE!  "!!! IALDABAOLOTH !!! COME FORTH !!!"
Wait
You wait, helplessly.  What happens next is rather unexpected.  The high pitched ringing sound reaches a crescendo, and without warning the upper half of the lighthouse explodes violently in a boiling fireball of violet flames. For a moment, Michael's lunatic grin of triumph remains frozen in place, licked by the purple radiance, not yet cognizant that the ritual has gone wrong. In the next instant, however, he is stricken.  "The mirror..." he whispers hoarsely.  Bits of burning debris are raining down on the island. The cultists fall back in panic and start pushing at each other to get off the island and escape. Many are pushed off into the water, where clusters of ropy, jellyfish like tentacles immediately drag them screaming beneath the waves. A burning chunk of masonry strikes one of your guards in the head, and he drops to the mud next to you with a mass of chewed spaghetti pulp where his face used to be. The other guard takes a quick, frightened look around, then bolts without a backward glance.  "Come back!" screams Michael. "Come back, cowards!" But no one heeds him. With a strangled curse he turns and hurls the torch into the sea.  Your score has just gone up by five points.
Pick cuffs with needle
(first taking the crusty needle) The metal cuffs bite painfully into your wrists, but with a little bit of excruciating contortion you manage to insert the end of the needle into the keyhole. For what seems like endless minutes, you jiggle the needle fruitlessly around, biting your lip against the cramps that keep trying to seize your painfully bent hands and bitterly reflecting that Linda Hamilton makes it look deceptively easy on the big screen    and suddenly the cuff snaps open. Quickly you free your other wrist, and the handcuffs slide free, landing in the muck.  The horrible, fleshy ground shudders beneath you. Bubbles begin to boil up around the island's edges.  "You    " Michael snarls at you, his voice a barely intelligible choke. The malice pouring out of his expression is almost more than you can bear to look at. "If I had the time I'd gut you right here and now    " suddenly the ground lurches slightly, and Michael smiles. "But perhaps I won't need to." With a mocking bow he strides past you and hops over to the shore. "I'm sorry I can't stay around to watch you die," he calls over his shoulder, "but I have some rather urgent business to attend to." The next moment he is gone, running down the breakwater toward town.
Free boy
Quickly you untie the bonds holding the boy to the stake; as his hands slip free he jumps away from you and eyes you warily. Then, sniffling and rubbing his arms, he runs to the edge of the island, hops over onto the breakwater and starts sprinting home.  The boiling is becoming more violent. You also notice that the tide seems to be striking the island a bit higher than before, even though the waves themselves aren't getting any taller.  Your score has just gone up by five points.
West
You hop across the water filled gap.  Rocky Spur A small outcropping of stone, just large enough for you to stand on, sticks out from the end of the breakwater. The hungry sea laps at your feet, surging over the rocks and then trickling down into crevices. To the southwest, an uneven trail leads back up the rocks, around the side of the lighthouse.  The sea thrashes against the shore with storm driven fury.  Beyond the breakwater's tip, a small island has risen from the sea. It is quickly sinking back into the churning waters.  The island is definitely sinking now.  Another wave crashes against the rocks, sending a cloud of spray into the air.
SW
The trail turns northwest, following the curve of the lighthouse wall.  At the Foot of the Lighthouse You stand in a circular clearing among the stones, surrounded on nearly every side by the sea. Before you looms the ancient, massive lighthouse, a vertiginous pillar of pale brick jabbing defiantly up at the sky. The road from the southwest ends here, although it looks as though you could pick your way down the rocks to the southeast, around the structure's base.  The sea thrashes against the shore with storm driven fury.  The great bronze door of the lighthouse stands slightly ajar, revealing a narrow rectangle of blackness within.
SW
Breakwater You are picking your way across the breakwater's bare, rocky spine, where the road has diminished to little more than a pair of dusty ruts. A hundred yards to the northeast, at the breakwater's far end, the lonely stone tower of Anchorhead's lighthouse stands vigil against the ocean.  The sea thrashes against the shore with storm driven fury.
West
Mill Road The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.
West
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air becomes warmer, more dingy, and slightly more difficult to breathe.  Entrance to the Paper Mill The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.  In the distance, you can hear the lonesome keening of a train whistle drifting on the wind. You look to the east in time to see the train go by, rolling southwest past the mill toward less melancholy climes.
North
Shanty Town The road peters out at a wide clearing of rutted mud, flanked by uneven rows of decrepit, clapboard shacks. The town is quiet, almost deserted; only a few bits of loose tarpaper blowing listlessly in the wind betray the overall stillness.  The young boy you freed from the island is standing here. He gives you a fearful glance.
Wait
Time passes.  Silently, the boy walks through the churning mud to the front steps of #11 Mill Town Road. For a moment, he stands there on the stoop, looking back at you; dirty, disheveled, drenched by the streaming rain. Then he turns and, raising his little fist, knocks on the door.  The door opens. The old woman looks out, then looks down. She sees the boy, and it seems that she becomes just a little bit younger at that moment. "My baby..." you hear her say, and then she is on her knees, folding her son into her arms. She stands, still holding him, and looks over his shoulder at you.  "Thank you," she says. Her eyes speak volumes of gratitude that her words will never be able to express. "Thank you for bringing him home."  And then she goes inside, and the door slowly closes behind her.
South
Entrance to the Paper Mill The road turns southwest here and runs squarely through the front entrance to the old paper mill. A gate of heavy iron bars blocks the only opening into this charred fortress, although an overgrown path leads around the wall to the south. To the north, a rutted lane threads its way past a row of dilapidated shacks.
East
As you cross the railroad tracks, the air seems to lift slightly, becoming more breathable once again.  Mill Road The road carries you across a desolate heath of gray, windswept grass. To the south, the black, jagged outline of Anchorhead's steep roofs and sharp, leaning gables cuts across the horizon. The road forks here to the west and east, heading across the railroad tracks in one direction, out toward the seashore in the other.
South
Junction To the north, a gap in the crowded press of gloomy buildings opens onto a country lane, heading out over a grassy heath. The main street continues to the east, while to the northwest, over the top of a steep rise, you can just make out the vaulted rooftops of the university.
East
Narrow Street As the lane winds along from east to west, it narrows until the steep, jagged rooftops on either side of the street practically touch each other. To the south, a side street leads across Whateley Bridge toward the center of town, and a twisting lane leads up a hill to the northwest. A short flight of steps to the north leads down to the local watering hole.  The rain slackens off momentarily to a weak drizzle, then returns afresh in a brief, freezing downpour.
South
Whateley Bridge A hoary monument of crumbling, moss eaten flagstones, Whateley Bridge is possibly older than any other structure in the entire city. Ponderously it spans the dark, torpid waters of the Miskaton River, connecting the north and south halves of the city and occasionally raining bits of gravel and mortar from its underside into the water. It looks just wide enough for two cars to pass each other between the flanking stone parapets, but you wouldn't volunteer to try it.  You can see a meat hook here.
South
Town Square A wide expanse of uneven pavestones lies open to the sky, bordered on all sides by the leaning, steep roofed architecture that looms over everything in this city. The municipal courthouse stands at the south end of the square, next to the mouth of a dark, narrow alley to the southwest. Avenues to the west and east lead back into the cramped and ingrown streets, while to the north lies Whateley Bridge.  Michael    or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body    is standing here.  The poor old man's mutilated corpse hangs from the top of the obelisk.  Michael looks at you and smiles. It is not a particularly pleasant smile. He walks over to the obelisk and places his hand against the bloodstained stone, then mutters something guttural under his breath. The twisted hieroglyphs begin to shine with an eerie phosphorescence which quickly brightens and envelopes Michael. His form wavers, then becomes transparent, and when the light fades he has disappeared.  The obelisk is still glowing.
Touch obelisk
As your fingers touch the gore streaked stone, the green light grows brighter, fanning out to envelope you. The odor of rotting fruit briefly assails your nostrils; your vision streaks, then blurs; there is the sound of rushing air, and when your eyes clear, you are somewhere else...  Burial Mound The cave is lined, floor to ceiling, with mummified human corpses. Shrunken and desiccated, they lie in jumbled heaps inside irregularly carved niches. Carvings cover the rock walls in between the niches    grotesque, leering faces too horrible even to look upon, their features twitching and smirking in the wavering light that sifts down from above.  Michael    or rather, the thing that has possessed Michael's body    is standing here.  The obelisk base stands before you, vast and shadowy in the green, murky light.  At the narrower, northern end of the vaguely egg shaped cavern sits a massive stone altar, flanked on either side by a pair of strange, vibrating columns.  Suddenly Michael lunges forward and grabs your arms. He shakes you, causing your head to whip back and forth and your teeth to click painfully together.  "Bitch    " he hisses, "    rotten, filthy bitch    you never give up, do you? You've foiled me for the last time! There's no way to fix what you've undone tonight, but by all the unholy spawn of darkness I will put you in a stone cold place for it!!" And his hands lock tightly around your throat and begin to squeeze.
Show ring to Michael
There is one chance    if you can only somehow reach whatever weak flicker of humanity still survives within that shell; if the person who was your husband still exists somewhere, buried beneath the part that is Croseus Verlac...  Silently, you raise up your left hand, your wedding ring gleaming softly in the strange, green light.  Michael is transfixed. He seems to want to recoil from the sight, yet is somehow simultaneously drawn to it. Suddenly, his face crumbles, the madness and stoic evil falling away to reveal confusion, fear, vulnerability and anguish    all superimposed upon the malevolent features of Croseus, struggling to regain control.  Your score has just gone up by five points.
Show amulet to Michael
(first taking the amulet) In his moment of hesitation, you see your chance; straining against his choking grip, you slip the amulet's cord around Michael's neck, letting the silver pendant drop to his chest.  Instantly Michael begins convulsing, arching his back and clawing at his chest. His jaws stretch open as if to release a howl of torment, but instead of voice, a thick, ropy stream of ectoplasmic mist pours from his throat. It pools into the center of the room, roils about, then coalesces into a human form    the vaporous, half rotted apparition of Croseus Verlac himself!  Michael lets out a weak groan.  Your score has just gone up by five points.
cover hole 3
(first taking the strange metal flute) You place your finger over the third flute hole.  Michael is doubled over with racking coughs, bringing up a thin trickle of blood.
cover hole 6
You place your finger over the sixth flute hole.  The ghost lets out a chilling, sepulchral laugh. "You useless, puny mortal," it cries. "Did you really think that there was any way on earth you could stop me? I have lived and thrived for over four hundred years    not even Death can claim me!"  Michael lets out a weak groan.
Play flute
(the strange metal flute) The flute emits an odd mixture of metallic, warbling notes which intertwine and harmonize eerily with each other.  The strange harmony of the flute blends with the atonal ringing of the two columns, and the three sounds suddenly grow stronger, resonating with and reinforcing one another, intertwining like a dissonant, invisible braid. The sound increases in volume, piercing your eardrums and causing the very air to shimmer.  Suddenly the air above the altar begins to ripple as though with extreme heat. The very fabric of space seems to twist and buckle between the two columns; and then, with a sound like a wet sheet being torn slowly down the middle, the fabric splits.  You are immediately swept off your feet by a powerful sucking vacuum, pulling everything within reach toward the portal. Dust and debris; bones and loose rock from the burial niches; everything not nailed down goes flying across the temple and into the all devouring maw hovering over the altar stone. Desperately, you wedge your fingers into a crack in the floor; with the other hand you grasp hold of Michael's pants leg and hang on for dear life.  Verlac is caught like a gossamer thread in a tornado. Frantically he claws at the air, but as an insubstantial ghost there is nothing for him to hang on to. Shrieking and cursing, he is dragged inexorably back, closer and closer to the portal, until the suction draws his corpus out into a long, trailing ribbon, like an unraveling cable knit sweater    and in the next moment he is gone forever, sucked into whatever alien dimension lies beyond that horrible rift.  For a few agonizing moments you don't think you're going to make it; then, suddenly, the chaos stops, leaving you breathless on the floor.  Painstakingly, you pry your stiff, bleeding fingers out of the crack and roll over. The rift is gone. The air is normal, and the columns are ringing quietly, as if nothing had happened.                                                                                  Silence reigns.  There passes some time that your memory cannot account for; a brief period of blackness and oblivion, you and your unconscious husband, together in the subterranean vault. Perhaps you were unconscious as well; you cannot remember. At some point you become conscious again. You lift Michael to his feet, putting his arm around your shoulders, and the two of you stagger up the titan stairs to the surface. The ground begins rumbling just as you are exiting the house, but by that time Michael has recovered some of his senses and can walk a bit faster.  You make it down to the bend in the road overlooking the town just in time to see the town square collapse, the vile obelisk sinking into the earth. Several buildings are dragged down along with it. A gas pipe ruptures in the courthouse, sending a gout of flame high into the air, and soon the entire town is burning.  Behind you, a muffled explosion and a sudden warmth against your back bespeak a similar end to the Verlac family mansion. For a moment you find yourself almost turning back, driven by instinct to rescue your belongings    but you stop. You turn away. And while Michael rests, you stand at the overlook and watch the sparks rise like fireflies, mingling with the stars in a clear, cloudless sky.

Home You are home, and it is a momentous event. Downstairs, Michael is waiting for you to bring him the wondrous news. To the east is the bedroom you both share, and to the north is your bathroom.  A cool wave of uneasiness washes slowly over you; you're not sure why.  Your score has just gone up by fifteen points.
Go north
You can barely feel yourself walking; it's almost as if some outer force were moving you of its own accord.  Your Bathroom Your bathroom; an ordinary place. A normal, safe, familiar place.  On the counter is a home pregnancy test.  "Well?" Michael calls excitedly from downstairs. "Have you looked yet?"
Get test
You pick up the home pregnancy test. It's an ordinary pregnancy test, the kind you can get at any drugstore; the kind with the little window that turns pink if you're going to have a baby.  Michael calls up again, this time sounding slightly worried: "Hon? Everything okay up there?"
Look at little window
What was that?  You freeze, all your senses on alert. Not mineral. Not vegetable, either. That means...animal? Your eyes scan the countryside, swiveling like searchlights, and pause briefly on a grove of trees to the north.  "No, not there! Up here!" guides a voice edged with impatience. As you whirl around, peering up, you squint and shield your eyes against the sun's glare. Waving at you from the top of a rickety wooden fence is a well groomed egg, who confesses, "I could use a bit of help, if you don't mind."  After a long and rather awkward silence, the egg mutters, "It's very rude to stare, you know. When I was your age, children were taught to respect their elders, not gawk at them as if they were animals in a zoo." The egg crosses his legs, folds his arms and pretends to ignore you.

Release 2 / Serial number 981128 / Inform v6.15 Library 6/7  Rickety Fence The ramshackle wooden fence in front of you seems to lurch from one horizon to the other. Although it hasn't fallen over yet, it threatens to at any moment, and if that egg isn't careful...  The footpath running along the fence veers sharply north.  The egg hums a little tune your mother used to sing at bedtime.
n
Bravely, the egg calls after you: "My life is in your hands! I trust you will return shortly to rescue me!"  Forest The sun has disappeared. Only a narrow north south passage winds through the forest here; trees and gnarled undergrowth barricade all other exits. Chill air seeps up from the ground and coils around your body, reaching down your neck with insistent, clammy fingers.
n
Deep Forest Wet branches slap your face, their icy needles stinging. Dense underbrush creeps in from all sides. With each step, mud oozes into your shoes. Insects drop from above and crawl through your hair; knuckles scrape against rough bark. The path hooks from south to southwest here, slithering between the trees like a snake. Faint rustling sounds catch your ear, but when you turn to look, all is still and quiet.  At your feet, a green and yellow basket lies on its side. Whoever dropped it must have been in a hurry, because the contents have spilled out and are strewn everywhere.  An iron pot has come to rest at the edge of the footpath, near a tree.  You can also see a cracked porcelain dish and a bent spoon here.
take pot
Taken.  The whispery rustling grows louder.
open pot
The lid and pot are so firmly attached to each other that you must tug with all your strength to separate them. All at once, without warning, the seal between them gives way. The lid flies out of your grasp and rolls out of sight.  Fortunately, you still have the pot. In it, you see some pease porridge.  You glance around nervously. The rustling seems very close now.
empty pot
You look around for an inconspicuous spot, and hastily dump the pease porridge. It soaks into the ground, but a shiny golden hairpin remains!  The rustling sounds stop.
drop pot
Dropped.  Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you glimpse a streak of moth eaten fur hurtling toward you from the forest! Your heart races, yet you stand paralyzed with fear; your mind screams at your unresponsive body to flee. Run! Run for your life!  Too late. Alas, too late.  "Boo!" snarls a big, bad wolf, who is huffing and puffing from all the exertion. His eyes narrow into slits as he studies you closely. "Hey, wait just a minute! You ain't Little Red Riding Hood."  The wolf loiters in the area, keeping an eye on you.

Country Lane The footpath snaking down from the northeastern forest has widened here into a country lane. Gravel crunches beneath your feet and a warm breeze riffles your hair as you walk in the sun. Some distance to the west, a few small cottages flock together like children telling secrets. Smoke curls from the chimney of the cottage nearest to you. Beyond the village, further west, a clock tower rises above the surrounding roofs.
w
Outside the Cottage Blooming with color and fragrance, a tidy garden snuggles against the stone cottage to the south. Ivy frames the whitewashed front door; starched white curtains hang in a diamond paned window. A faint path forks southeast and southwest around the cottage, toward the back. To the north, across the lane that runs through the village, a few small cottages line the road. The clock tower looms further west, silhouetted against the sky.  Gradually, the steady, monotonous hum of machinery drifts into your consciousness.  The wolf is back again, hanging around.  The wolf yawns widely enough for you to count all his teeth.
w
Outside the Bungalow A cheery pink bungalow with gingerbread trim and a yellow painted door nestles behind the picket fence to the south. Grass covers the yard from corner to corner, except at the edges, where flowers dance with the fence. Circling the bungalow to the southeast and southwest, a faint path leads around the back. To the north, a few small homes peer across the lane, which has narrowed, but still runs east to west at this end of the village. The clock tower dominates the skyline to the west.  A white rectangle in the middle of the bright yellow door catches your eye.

"Who's there?" a voice inquires from inside the bungalow.

The door opens a crack. "Boo who?"

Before you can reply, the bungalow door slams open and a voice shouts: "Don't cry; it's just a joke!"  Then a whirlwind  no, it's a little girl  hurtles through the door and almost collides with you. "I just love knock knock jokes, don't you?" she giggles, clapping her hands and pirouetting in place. "I'm Mary. Who are you?"  [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

"You can borrow the ladder if you'll hand over my friend's hairpin," Mary bargains, pointing. "Just return the ladder when you're finished, okay?"

Mary tags along behind you.  Meadow Behind the Bungalow Grass surrounds you, acres of it, spreading across the countryside as far as you can see. A ribbon of flattened grass curves eastward, and another, not quite as fresh, circles the bungalow, branching northeast and northwest. A grass covered hill to the southwest shimmers under the sun's heat; waves of green gold grass ripple toward the crest of the hill, racing the wind to the top.  Mary points to the hairpin. "I think that belongs to a friend of mine. She lost it last week. Want me to return it?"  A wooden ladder lies half hidden in the grass next to the bungalow.  A cuddly lamb prances about, seemingly unaware of your presence.

"I'll let you borrow the ladder if you'll give me that hairpin," Mary bargains. "I'm positive it's the one my friend lost last week, and I'd like to give it back to her. Deal?"

"Bye!" Mary waves. "See you later!"  Hilltop Grass sweeps up the hill like a brushfire, growing taller and thicker as it approaches the top where you brace yourself against the wind. You can see everything from up here: the forest, the village, even the fence where you first met the egg. The schoolhouse and its clock tower lie to the northwest.  A crumbling brick well sits at the very top of the hill, almost hidden in a nest of grass. It's the simplest of designs  no cute roof, no crank, no rope or bucket  just a simple, brick cylinder in the ground. The cover, if it ever had one, is gone. From deep within the well's depths, you hear faint scratching noises interspersed with pathetic mewing.
put ladder in well
You lower the ladder into the well. It drops a few feet and hits bottom, but you can still reach in and touch it.
here kitty kitty
In a moment, the ladder begins to shudder and shake, rattling noisily against the inside of the well. It rests for a moment, then quivers again. You peer down into the darkness. Something is climbing toward you, slipping and sliding, but making progress nevertheless. Finally, after several minutes, a tiny gray and white ball of wet fur scrambles to the top of the ladder and pokes its head into the sunshine. The kitten sneezes twice in the daylight before leaping from the ladder to the edge of the well. It raises its tail straight up in the air like a flagpole, marches once around the top ledge, and from there springs to the grass at your feet. Purring, it licks one paw and washes its face.

You lean the ladder against the fence and stand back, not quite sure what to do next. However, the egg, surprisingly nimble for such an awkward looking creature, turns himself around and climbs down rapidly, obviously accustomed to this sort of rescue service. Once down, he grabs your hand and shakes it vigorously. "Thank you, thank you so much," the egg exclaims again and again. "Really, I can't thank you enough."  Finally, his gratitude properly expressed, the egg waddles away, turning to wave goodbye one last time before he disappears completely. "You saved my life!" he shouts. "I won't forget you!"

"Bye!" Mary waves. "See you later!"  Hilltop
nw
Schoolyard Both the playground and its adjacent schoolhouse to the south lie vacant and deserted. The bare, hard packed rectangle of earth, despite a few faint chalk marks, shows no evidence that children may have once played here  or might ever play here again.  The lane ends its westward progress at the schoolhouse door. At the southern end of the school, a magnificent stone steeple towers above the village roofs. To see the clock from where you now stand, you must tilt your head back and point your chin at the sky. To the southeast, a gentle slope leads to a hilltop covered with wild grass.  The kitten purrs and rubs against your legs.
s
Inside the School The abandoned schoolroom lacks not only pupils, but also books and pencils and chalk and paper and any other hint that someone might show up for school tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next. Rows of empty desks and chairs face the teacher's desk at the front of the room as if waiting expectantly for the day's lesson. The door to the north leads back out to the empty schoolyard. Stairs to the south lead up into darkness.  The kitten crouches low, wiggles its rear, and then pounces at nothing.
s
Clock Tower Stairs Dimly lit stairs lead up toward darkness and down into the schoolroom below. Each step sings a different tune for you: one groans mournfully the instant you put your weight on it; the next squeaks in protest just as you step off. At the top of the stairs, a heavy, solid door stands firmly closed.  The kitten suddenly darts between your legs and zigzags up the steps ahead of you. At that very instant, a tiny brown field mouse scurries across your path, barely escaping with its life when you accidently step on its tail. Chaos erupts. The terrified mouse races in circles, dodging feet and claws. The kitten spits and hisses and rears back on its hind legs, then lunges for the mouse. You hop on one foot, howling with pain, having twisted your ankle while trying to avoid the mouse. To top it all off, someone...or something...is pounding on the other side of the door at the top of the stairs.
take kitten
You scoop the squirming kitten into your arms, where it struggles to free itself, its eyes riveted on the mouse below. The mouse, quick to recognize this once in a lifetime opportunity, dashes under the door. With one last twisting backwards flip, the kitten launches itself from your embrace and lands on its feet, ready for battle.  Without warning, a single deep, booming gong rocks the tower. Your hands fly up involuntarily to cover and protect your ears, and you drop everything you're carrying. The vibration of the tolling bell resonates through your chest, even after the audible tone fades. In the silence that follows, you hear the sound of running feet, first nearby, then receding, from the other side of the door.  The kitten, ever curious, shoves one paw between the threshold and the door, groping blindly for the escaped mouse. A few swipes later, something metallic skitters across the floor and into the corner.  The wolf sneaks up behind you.  The kitten arches its back and hisses at the wolf.

You unlock the clock tower door and open it.  Loud clicks and whirring noises are coming from inside the room to the south.
s
Inside the Clock Tower Dim, greenish light from above reflects off an assortment of large brass gears mounted flat against a stone wall on the far side of the room. Taut cables run upward through a network of pulleys, vanishing into the gloom more than twenty feet above your head. The entire mechanism turns and meshes in a slow, rhythmic, hypnotic clockwork dance.  The wolf is back again, hanging around.  The wolf grins at you as he twirls the toothpick in his mouth.  As your eyes adjust to the room's dim light, you notice a shadowy figure standing to one side.
x figure
You squint, peering through the shadows. "Mom?"  It's your mother! What's she doing here?  Your mother gathers you inside the circle of her arms and hugs until you can hardly breathe. Then she picks you up and twirls you around, skimming your feet over the floor as she whirls. She laughs out loud. "You found me!" When she puts you down again, you feel a little dizzy.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

"Yes, let's go home," agrees your mother, taking your hand. "We can tell each other all about our adventures on the way."  Planting a kiss on top of your head, your mother says, "Before I forget, I want to tell you how proud I am of you. Not many people  adults or children  could have done what you did today without getting into at least a little trouble along the way. My goodness, I couldn't have done it myself, especially with that wolf annoying me the entire time!"  How does she do that? How on earth could she possibly know what you did or didn't do while she was locked inside the clock tower? How, how, how does she always find out? You'd give anything to know her secret, but she won't tell.  [Your score has just gone up by twenty points.]

Time passes.  "Listen up," warns the wolf. "In case you forgot, I get blamed for everything around here. So watch it. I ain't takin' no rap for you."  A door slams in the distance. Not a moment later, you hear footsteps clattering up the stairs, and a breathless egg rushes into the room.  "The clock! I heard it!" shouts the egg. "What's going on here? Who are you? How did you get in? When did..." He stops to wipe his face with a sweat soaked handkerchief, peering first at you, then at your mother. As his eyes grow accustomed to the gloom, he gasps in recognition. "Mother Loose! Mother Loose! Is it you? Are you all right? I'm so glad..." Then the honorable Mr. Humpty Dumpty falls over in a dead faint.  "Poor Mr. Dumpty," your mother sympathizes, kneeling next to the egg and patting his limp hand. "Too much excitement." She winks at you. "By the way, thanks for getting him down off that fence." You open your mouth to ask how she knew, but close it again without bothering. She'll never tell, so what's the use in asking?  "Here, splash a little water on him," your mother suggests, handing you a water bottle with not much water in it. You sprinkle a few drops on the egg's eyes and they flutter a bit before one of them opens. Groaning, the egg sits up. "It is, oh, it truly is you," he sighs happily. Both his eyes open wide then, and he jumps...well, rises as quickly as his awkward shape will allow. "I must inform the authorities," he announces importantly. "Mother Loose, will you be all right? Do you need an ambulance? I can call the king's horses and men  pardon me, I meant troops  pardon me, I meant...oh, dear, oh, dear, I don't know what I meant!"  Your mother pats the egg's hand calmly. "I just need to go home and rest for a day or two," she says. "I'm perfectly fine, really. I'll call you tomorrow and tell you the whole story, all right?" The egg nods and, with a quick glance over his shoulder, bustles out of the room and down the stairs.  Exhausted, you stand motionless in the center of the room, head down, staring at the kitten winding in and out around your ankles. As you watch, the kitten curls up on your foot, ready for a nap. You wiggle your toes, but the drowsy kitten simply yawns. So do you. When you open your eyes (you can't remember shutting them), the kitten is settled comfortably against your mother's shoulder, purring.  Mother Loose takes your hand in hers. "Come on, sleepyhead," she whispers. "Time to go home."                                                And you all live happily ever after.                                                              THE END

"Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"  Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of Thermofax.  Only your Magick sword can save you now. You swing it high, speak the Word and stand unhurt as the blade absorbs the searing dragon breath.  The reptile bellows with rage and flaps its wings to fan the fire in its belly. You are advancing, sword poised to strike, when a familiar voice shatters the daydream and stays your mighty hand...

Release 68 / Serial Number 850501  Hilltop You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Festeron.  To the south stands the Festeron Post Office.

Somebody inside the Post Office is calling you.  Okay, what do you want to do now?

Looking southwest, you can see the shadow of Post Office Hill creeping across the village as the sun sinks into a bank of clouds.  The peaceful scenery is disturbed by a tiny figure emerging from the distant Post Office. It stares in your direction for a few moments, checks its wrist and shakes a threatening little fist at you.  A little old fashioned store stands nearby. Its brightly painted shutters and thatched roof remind you of something out of a fairy tale. A curiously painted sign over the front door reads, "Ye Olde Magick Shoppe."
OPEN DOOR
A concealed bell tinkles merrily.  Okay, the Magick Shoppe door is now open.
IN
Magick Shoppe You're in the front showroom of the Magick Shoppe.  Every inch of wall space is crowded with magic tricks, puzzles and mystical paraphernalia. A glass case offers a selection of obscene jokes and naughty birthday cards.  In the corner stands an ancient grandfather clock, its dial ornamented with a smiling crescent moon and other celestial symbols.  The front door of the Magick Shoppe is wide open. At the west end of the room, you can see another exit concealed by a curtain.  A sudden gust of wind slams the Magick Shoppe door closed. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.  "Just a moment!" cries a voice behind the curtain.
WAIT
Time passes.  The noisy tick of the grandfather clock is making you uneasy.
WAIT
Time passes.  The curtain opens so quickly it makes you jump.  The woman standing before you is older than your oldest aunt. Her thin, pale face and bony hands make her look fragile, like a fading signature in an antique book. But her eyes remember everything they have ever seen.  You appraise one another for a long moment before she breaks the ice. "Welcome in, welcome!" she chortles. "Don't get many visitors this late in the day."  The room seems oddly quiet all of a sudden.
GIVE ENVELOPE TO WOMAN
(Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 20 out of 100.)  The old woman turns pale as she takes the mysterious envelope from you. "It's been a long, long time since I last saw this handwriting," she murmurs, turning it over in her hands. "Hoped I never would again."  She starts to open the mysterious envelope, thinks better of it and hands it back to you. "Will you open it up and read it to me?" she pleads. "I'll never find my glasses in this mess."  (You are again holding the mysterious envelope.)
OPEN ENVELOPE
(You should now open the mysterious envelope in your Wishbringer package.)  Opening the mysterious envelope reveals a letter.  "Go ahead, dear. Read the letter to me, please. I'm waiting."
READ LETTER TO WOMAN
(Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 21 out of 100.)  The old woman is motionless as you read. Glancing up, you see tears of anger forming; but she turns away as your eyes meet.  "Kidnapped," she whispers after a long silence. She paces aimlessly around the room, deep in thought.  "Many seek to gain the Stone of Dreams," she mutters, mostly to herself. "Yet few can imagine the price. For years I have fought to conceal it from the Evil One and others like her. My youth, my home and family, all were forfeited for its protection. And now," her voice breaking with emotion, "now it claims my only companion."  Impulsively, the woman snatches away the letter and envelope and crumbles them in her trembling hands. "No one is strong enough to guard Wishbringer alone."
WAIT
Time passes.  The old woman makes an effort to compose herself.  "Thank you for coming all this way for me," she says, reaching up to a shelf full of cheap gags. "I know I'm not supposed to tip you, but take this little trinket anyway."  The woman holds out a small metal can for you to take.

WAIT
Time passes.  You hear a rattling noise in the can.  The old woman hobbles over to the Magick Shoppe door and opens it. A concealed bell tinkles merrily.  "Keep a sharp eye out for my cat, won't you?" She speaks the words slowly and distinctly. "Bring her to me if you find her. She's black as night from head to tail, except for one little white spot... right HERE."  The old woman touches the middle of your forehead with her finger. The light outside dims suddenly, like a cloud passing over the sun.
WAIT
Your body seems unwilling to respond.  The old woman takes away her finger. Your forehead is tingling.  "The Stone of Dreams can help you in your search. I cannot reveal the place where I have hidden it, for the Evil One would see your thoughts and take the treasure for herself. You must discover it alone, and rely on legends to instruct you in its mysteries."  As she speaks, the old woman gently leads you through the door of the Magick Shoppe. She pauses before closing the door.  "Return the cat to me, and Wishbringer shall be yours.  "Her name is Chaos."  A concealed bell tinkles merrily.                       Cliff Edge You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward.  The surrounding landscape has disappeared under a thick blanket of evening fog. All the familiar buildings and landmarks are completely hidden; only the summit of Post Office Hill is high enough to pierce the cloud, rising like a lonely island in a sea of mist...  ... an island with a tower on it.  There's a TOWER where the Post Office used to be! The massive outline is hard to make out against the twilight sky. But the longer you stare, the clearer and more frightening it becomes.  The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.

North of Bridge This is the north side of the Witchville Bridge. Sheer cliff walls rise abruptly to the north and west. A path wanders east along the shore of the river.  A rickety toll gate has been thrown up across the entrance to the covered bridge. A handpainted sign is nailed to the middle of the closed gate.  Standing near the toll gate is an ugly, gnomelike creature. A less original story would probably refer to it as a troll.
OPEN CAN
Yow! When you open the can a real, live rattlesnake leaps out! It squirms about angrily for a few moments, turns to hiss at you and slithers out of sight.  The metal can clatters to the ground.  A scream of terror echoes off the cliffs as the troll runs away across the covered bridge.  (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 27 out of 100.)

W
River Outlet This is where the lake empties into the Witchville River. A road leads south along the edge of the lake, and bends east to follow the river bank. A narrow trail leads upward to the top of Lookout Hill.
S
Lake Edge You're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking south, you can see a closed iron gate leading into the Witchville Cemetery.  Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the water.  You can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake. Animal tracks are visible in the sand next to the pit.
LOOK IN PIT
The pit is more than five feet deep. You can see a platypus in it.  A rusty "click!" draws your eyes to the iron gate. You watch as it slowly creaks open, all by itself!
PUT BRANCH IN PIT
Okay, the dead branch is now standing up inside the pit.  The platypus grabs onto the bottom of the dead branch with its forepaws.  You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the east.

It lets go when the branch clears the edge and waddles joyfully around on the sand.  The little creature draws an "X" in the sand with its tail. Then it gives you an oddly dignified nod of thanks, waddles to the edge of the lake and disappears into the dark water.

BLOW IT
A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.  The silver whistle's music echoes over the lake, rippling the water with gentle Magick. A sudden gust of wind blows through your hair. You can see the soft outline of Misty Island drawing closer as you streak across the waves...                      Misty Island You're standing on a fog shrouded beach. Sheer cliff walls rise to the north and south, and the dark waters of the lake stretch eastward.  To the west stands a magnificent castle, its parapets rising high into the mist. Golden light streams invitingly through the open entrance. You can hear friendly voices and music inside.
W
Throne Room You're standing in a long, high ceilinged chamber. Hundreds of platypuses are milling about with teacups in their paws, their faces illuminated by a roaring fireplace.  At the far end of the chamber stands a mighty throne. It's occupied by a snow white platypus with a gold crown on its head and a jeweled scepter in its paw. On the floor near the throne is another crowned platypus... the same one you rescued from the pit.  The crowd falls silent as you enter.  "Welcome, brave Adventurer," says the white platypus, rising from its throne to greet you. "I am Anatinus, King of Misty Island. My court thanks you most humbly for rescuing the life of my daughter, Princess Tasmania. Great would our sorrow have been if not for your cunning."  The crowd applauds politely, and Princess Tasmania blushes.
WAIT
Time passes.  "My messengers have told me of your quest," continues King Anatinus. "Allow me to repay your kindness with words of advice."  The old platypus motions you to his side. "The Tower of the Evil One is formidable," he begins in a low, serious voice. "You will never get inside unaided. Legends speak of a Magick Word that can open the gates of the Tower. But what Word it is, none can say."  The king reaches beneath his throne and takes out a small wizard's hat. "Take this," he says, holding it out to you.
GET HAT

WAIT
Time passes.  A fanfare of trumpets breaks the silence, and the crowd falls to its knees.  "Good luck to you, brave Adventurer!" cries King Anatinus, bowing deeply. "Now blow into the silver whistle one more time, and deliver us from the horror of the Evil One."  The platypuses look at you expectantly.
BLOW WHISTLE

You feel the silver whistle slip from your hand as you streak across the lake...                      Lake Edge You're on the sandy shore of the lake. A road heads east towards the village, and another runs north along the edge of the lake. Looking south, you can see an open iron gate leading into the Witchville Cemetery.  Misty Island, its outline shrouded in fog, is visible far across the water.  You can see a narrow pit near the edge of the lake.   A dead branch is lying on the ground.
S
The cemetery is a spooky place, especially at night. Are you sure you want to go in there?  (Please type YES or NO.)
YES
You have been warned.  Twilight Glen The trees here are so thick, it's almost too dark to see! You can make out an open iron gate to the north, and a narrow lane between the tombstones winds off to the east.  There must have been a burial here recently. Somebody left their umbrella leaning up against a tombstone.  As you glance around you notice luminous ribbons of mist darting among the tombstones. The air is filled with sinister voices.
E
Spooky Copse A copse of willow trees makes this part of the cemetery look really spooky. Narrow lanes wander south and west.  There's an open grave nearby, freshly dug, with a tombstone erected next to it.  The luminous mists suddenly condense into a cloud of eldritch vapors! Circling like sharks, they stroke your face with ghostly fingers and whisper dreadful secrets into your ears.
D
The eldritch vapors moan with disappointment as you escape their misty clutches.  Open Grave You're at the bottom of an open grave, surrounded by six foot walls of dirt. Luminous ribbons of mist are swarming overhead, and a dark hole is visible in the north wall.
N
Underground You're in a dirty underground chamber. Long, smelly tunnels wander away to the north and east, and there's a dark hole in the south wall.

U
With great effort, you manage to squeeze yourself into the hole.  Jail Cell You're locked inside a damp, uncomfortable jail cell. Its thick steel door and stone walls offer little hope for escape.  The only furnishing is a hard bunk in the middle of the floor with a thick blanket on it.  There's a dark, narrow hole in the floor.

E
Grue's Nest You have stumbled into the nesting place of a family of grues. Congratulations. Few indeed are the adventurers who have entered a grue's nest and lived as long as you have.  Everything is littered with rusty swords of elvish workmanship, piles of bones and other debris. A closed refrigerator stands in one corner of the nest, and something... a small, dangerous looking little beast... is curled up in the other corner.  The only exit is to the west. Hope you survive long enough to use it.  Snoring fitfully, the little beast turns away from the light of the small stone and faces the wall.
PUT BLANKET ON GRUE
Okay, the little beast is now covered with the thick blanket.  The creature stirs restlessly for an anxious moment. Then it settles into the comfortable darkness of the thick blanket, sighs gently and lies still.  (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 47 out of 100.)

Underground You're in a damp underground chamber. Cold, dark tunnels wander away to the south and east.  The surrounding walls are almost obscured by the roots of a mighty tree. Overhead you can see the underside of a large stump. It appears to be hinged.
OPEN STUMP
Lifting the hinged top of the stump reveals a round hole leading upward into moonlight.
U
Lookout Hill You're standing at the summit of a high, barren hill. Looking east, you can see Witchville Village nestled among the trees. A narrow trail winds down the north side of the hill, towards the river.  Crowning the hill is the stump of what must have been a very large and majestic oak tree. An opening in the stump leads down into darkness.  A horseshoe is lying in the grass near the stump.

Rocky Path You're on a rocky path that runs east and west along the banks of the Witchville River. A shimmering trail leads south into a dense forest.
S
As you walk along the shimmering trail you feel a vague sense of disorientation, then a shock of recognition...                      West of House You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.  There's a little mailbox here.
OPEN MAILBOX
Opening the little mailbox reveals a leaflet.  The edges of the little mailbox are beginning to twinkle.
WAIT
Time passes.  The little mailbox is engulfed in a sparkling aurora! Tremors of anticipation run up and down its length, and the air sings with Magick.
WAIT
Time passes.  With a gentle pop, the little mailbox pulls itself out of the ground and cavorts about the grass like a happy rabbit!
WAIT
Time passes.  The little mailbox notices you and snaps its tiny lid with joy. It makes a silly "clump clump, clump clump" sound as it hops to your side and rubs lovingly against your sleeve.

As the house disappears into the distance, you get the distinct feeling that, someday, you will pass this way again.                      Rocky Path
E
Lighthouse This is where the river empties into Witchville Bay. A path leads west along the riverbank.  A broken down old lighthouse, barely ten feet high, stands on the shore nearby.  Perched on top of the lighthouse is a pelican, watching you through half closed eyelids.
GIVE HAT TO PELICAN
The pelican sniffs the wizard's hat suspiciously. Its eyes open wide with interest, and the wizard's hat quickly finds a place on the pelican's head. Then the old bird gives you a sly, knowledgeable wink.  All at once the lighthouse blazes to life! Its shining beacon whirls like a gyroscope, and a pencil thin beam of light pierces the sky and traces a word on a passing cloud: KALUZE.  The pelican spreads its wings and soars away over the bay. As the beam of the lighthouse fades, a voice in your head whispers, "Good luck, brave Adventurer!"  (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 55 out of 100.)  The little mailbox "clump clumps" to your side with a joyful snap.

Park You're standing in a circular park, surrounded by the Witchville Rotary. Walks converge from four directions on a neglected marble fountain, filled with greasy water.  A statue stands in the middle of the fountain.  You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the west.
LOOK IN FOUNTAIN
You can see a brass token and a piranha in the fountain.  The little mailbox "clump clumps" happily into view.  You can hear the tramp of marching boots to the north.

It lands in the fountain with a splash.  The piranha snatches away the worm and swims to the far side of the fountain to devour it.  The little mailbox rubs your leg.

Rotary East You're on the eastern side of the Witchville Rotary. A street branches off to the east, towards the bay.  On the corner nearby stands a sleazy little movie theater. Showtimes and admission prices are listed on a schedule near the open entrance, and a marquee announces the current feature.  Miss Voss, the former town librarian, is peering at you suspiciously.
BUY TICKET
(with the gold coin) Miss Voss snatches away your gold coin with her bony fingers and hands you a ticket.  (You are now holding a ticket.)  (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 61 out of 100.)  The little mailbox "clump clumps" happily into view.
IN
Theater Lobby You're standing in the lobby of the movie theater. A short corridor leads north into darkness. Sound effects and music can be heard drifting down the corridor.  The gravedigger is standing near the corridor, a large cardboard carton at his feet.
SHOW TICKET TO GRAVEDIGGER
The gravedigger takes the ticket, gestures absently to the empty carton and leans back to daydream.
N
The gravedigger nods as you pass.  Inside Theater This is a movie theater unlike any you've ever seen! The seats are wide, deep and comfortable. The aisles are spotless. The air is clear of smoke, and the screen is dramatically large. A chill goes up your spine as you realize how alien your universe has become.  There's a noisy movie playing on the screen. A dark corridor leads out to the lobby.  The picture on the screen is fuzzy and hard to watch.
EXAMINE FLOOR
Hmm. This place isn't completely spotless. You just discovered a used pair of 3D glasses under a seat.  The screen image is a meaningless blur of colored light.

YES
"Come again!" sneers the gravedigger as you leave.  Rotary East  There's a little mailbox with a leaflet in it here.  Out of the corner of your eye, you notice Miss Voss squinting carefully at the gold coin you gave her. She looks at you suspiciously, picks up a telephone and begins to dial rapidly.
E
Pleasure Wharf You're standing near the remains of the Pleasure Wharf. The Wharf extends eastward into Witchville Bay.  To the south stands a ramshackle old building. Colorful lights, curious electronic sounds and a neon sign beckon you through the open entrance.  A big mailbox is nearby.  A voice behind you growls, "Mail!" You turn to face the sound, but there's nobody here except you.
WAIT
Time passes.  You watch with astonishment as the lid of the big mailbox slowly opens by itself, then snaps shut with a clang.  The little mailbox "clump clumps" to your side with a joyful snap.
WAIT
Time passes.  The lid of the big mailbox opens again. "I want MAIL!"  The two mailboxes freeze at the sight of one another.  The little mailbox snarls and stands protectively by your side. The big mailbox emits a frightful growl and throws its lid wide open, displaying rows of sharp little teeth. A crowd of postal meters and stamp dispensers gathers as the metal warriors circle each other with tense, snapping lids.  With a sudden rush, the little mailbox throws itself at the big mailbox and clamps onto its forefoot. The big mailbox roars with anger, bites the little mailbox viciously and tries in vain to shake it off. You stare in wonder as the fighting boxes swell to twice their normal size, then four times larger, eight times!  The big mailbox frees itself with a savage twist and bends to finish its foe. The little mailbox dodges, grips the descending lid and holds on for dear life. Locked in mortal combat, the giant boxes roll over and over, shaking the earth with the thunder of battle.  The scene disappears under a cloud of dust. You hear a terrible scream of agony, then an even more terrible silence. When the air clears, the boxes and spectators are gone.
S
Video Arcade This old building is the home of a sleazy arcade, lined with coin op video games. The machines are crowded with half crazed, stunted humanoids, who pay no attention to you as they satisfy their thirst for electric violence.  One machine in the corner appears to be deserted.  A sign on the wall says, "All Games One Token."
PUT TOKEN IN SLOT
The brass token disappears into the slot.  Ding! You hear a pleasant electric chime, and a blinking star appears on the video screen.  (Your score just went up by 1 point! Your total score is 65 out of 100.)  (This might be a good time to SAVE your story position.)

The stunted humanoids in the arcade watch you carefully as your hand touches the flashing button. This might be a trap! You don't really want to press that big red button, do you?  (Please type YES or NO.)
YES
(Hope you saved your story position.)  A sudden power drain makes all the other games in the arcade go dim. Blue sheets of energy leap from the game machine, surrounding you in an incandescent aura. You can feel your molecules being taken apart one at a time, analyzed, modulated and broadcast through space. It is not a pleasant sensation.                      Hilltop You're on a hilltop overlooking the seaside village of Witchville.  A tower stands in bleak silhouette against the moonlit sky. It rises a hundred feet above a barren plateau, and is encircled by a deep moat. The only entrances are a closed drawbridge and a dark window near the top.  Roads run down the hill to the east and west. There's a signpost nearby.  A synthetic voice says, "Game Over. Insert Token To Play Again."  (Your score just went up by 5 points! Your total score is 70 out of 100.)
SAY KALUZE
With a great creak of wood and rattle of chains, the drawbridge slowly lowers across the moat.  (Your score just went up by 3 points! Your total score is 73 out of 100.)  (This might be a good time to SAVE your story position.)
S
Vestibule You're standing in a dimly lit vestibule just inside the tower's entrance. The drawbridge is opened across the moat to the north. A short corridor leads south, into the tower.  "Turn back, brave Adventurer!"  You stare in horror at the platypus chained to the floor. It's Princess Tasmania!
WAIT
Time passes.  "Behind you!" cries the Princess. "It's a trap!"  Too late. The drawbridge crashes shut against the tower wall. You turn to face your enemy, and find yourself staring into the open maw of... Mr. Crisp!  "Nice of you to drop by," he sneers as a gigantic Boot pins you to the ground. "Saves me the bother of tracking you down."                      Torture Chamber You're chained up in the corner of a dim, stuffy chamber, deep within the bowels of the tower. The walls gleam with obscure medical instruments, and a diabolical torture machine occupies most of the opposite corner.  Princess Tasmania is clamped into the torture machine!  A ladder rises to meet an open hatch in the middle of the ceiling.  Mr. Crisp is fondling the instruments, one by one.
GIVE NOTE TO MR CRISP
Mr. Crisp takes the violet note and stares at it. His face turns pale. "Where did this come from?" he whispers, opening it.  An unbearably sweet expression spreads over his face as he reads. The violet note falls from his hands.  "I've got to run," Mr. Crisp cries, tossing his white lab coat into a corner and stuffing his shirttails into his pants. "Violet scolds me when I'm late!" He struggles into a hideous velvet blazer, pushes a comb through his hair and scampers up the ladder like a little boy.  The hatch closes with a hollow thud.
GET COAT
The chains cut painfully into your wrist as you strain to grasp the white lab coat. Your fingertips brush against the collar... There! You got it!  You hear the distant rattle of the drawbridge opening.  Princess Tasmania breathes a sigh of relief.
LOOK IN COAT

The platypus humbly licks your shoe, to your considerable embarrassment. "My father, King Anatinus, does not forget such kindness."  The little creature produces a silver whistle from her gown and blows into it gently. A clear, sweet note stills the night with its beauty.  "Your journey is not yet ended," she warns as a whirlpool of colored light envelops her. "But even if you fail, your deeds shall live forever in our legends. Have faith!"  When the colors fade, Princess Tasmania is gone.

As you approach the cottage you are greeted by the biggest hellhound you've ever seen in your entire life. It charges across the street, roaring angrily and showing its sharp, bloody fangs.  You can smell the hellhound's hot breath as it roars.

Museum Formerly a popular tourist attraction, the old Festeron Museum is in a sorry state. Many of the best exhibits have been carted away; the few remaining are sorely in need of renovation.  Fortunately, one of your childhood favorites is still intact. It's a pair of enormous fossil mailboxes, their metal bones locked together in a pose of eternal combat.  There's a glass display case in the corner. You can see a sculpture in the case.
SMASH CASE WITH BROOM
Crash! You broke the display case open with the broom.
EXAMINE SCULPTURE
The black marble sculpture is about 14 inches high. It's exquisitely crafted in the likeness of a cat.  You can see a round, shallow hole carved into the forehead of the sculpture.
INSERT WISHBRINGER IN SCULPTURE
Wishbringer glows brighter as it nears the sculpture. It looks like it will fit perfectly into the black forehead.  "Wait!" commands a familiar voice.  You turn, and see the figure of an old woman standing in the darkness of the corridor.  "Your quest is ended, brave Adventurer," says the old woman. "The sculpture you see before you is Chaos, the Cat Which Was Stolen. Now give Wishbringer to me, and together we shall rejoice in your success."  Do you still want to put Wishbringer into the sculpture?  (Please type YES or NO.)
YES
"Don't!" barks the old woman as your hand moves closer to the sculpture.  Do you still want to put Wishbringer into the sculpture?  (Please type YES or NO.)

"No!"  A blast of Magick shakes the building as Wishbringer touches the forehead of the sculpture. Violet sheets of energy, pure and brilliant, erupt from the very heart of the Stone and illuminate the room like daylight.  The woman's disguise evaporates in the glare. It's the Evil One, her mouth frozen open in a wail of despair as she fades into oblivion. The memory of that face will haunt your dreams as long as you live.  You watch as the sculpture begins to soften in the radiance. It wriggles like a thing alive, leaps across the floor and disappears into a vortex of color. The library folds around you like the closing of a great book...                      Cliff Edge You're standing high on a rocky cliff, at the top of a steep trail leading downward. Looking southeast, you see a friendly orange sun rising from a bank of morning clouds.  Post Office Hill is visible to the south, topped as usual by the Festeron Post Office.  The Magick Shoppe stands nearby.  A black cat is rubbing against your leg.

You click the box for your paper, and the box grows reassuringly until it fills most of the screen. Unfortunately, the text that fills it bears no resemblance to your paper. The title is the same, but after that, there is something different, very different.
READ PAGE
The paper appears to be a facsimile overlaid with occasional typescript. The text is mostly in a sort of "Olde English" you've never seen before. What you read is a combination of incomprehensible gibberish, latinate pseudowords, debased Hebrew and Arabic scripts, and an occasional disquieting phrase in English.  As you look at it more closely, you find it hard to focus on the screen, but impossible to look away. Your finger strays toward the "MORE" box...
CLICK ON MORE
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.  The second page is much like the first, but around the edges, not when you look at it straight, it's almost readable. There is something about a "summoning," or a "visitor."
AGAIN
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.  The third page is in the same script as the first, but laid out like a poem. There are woodcut illustrations which are queasily disturbing.  There is a translation, or notes for one, typed between the lines of the poem:  "He returns, he is called back (?) The loyal ones (acolytes?) make a sacrifice Those who survive will meet him (be absorbed? eaten?) They will live, yet die Forever will be (is?) nothing to them (to him?)  "His place (lair? burrow?) must be prepared His food (offerings?) must be prepared Call him forth (invite him?) with great power Only an acceptable (tasteful?) sacrifice will call him forth He will be grateful (satiated?)"  The rest is even more fragmentary.
AGAIN
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.  The fourth page is a photograph. You try to recoil from the screen, but cannot. Fascinated and repelled at the same time, you wonder: is that a mouth, and what is in it?
AGAIN
You touch the MORE box, and a new page appears.  You faint, and when you awaken...   [Use $SOUND to toggle sound usage on and off.]  Place This is a place. Things move about on a broken, rocky surface. Harsh sounds split the air. Something sticky grabs at your feet. There is no color, everything is drained of brightness, dull and lifeless. A path descends into a shallow bowl of black basalt.
D
Basalt Bowl You are at the bottom of a deeply cut, smooth basalt bowl. Dimly seen shapes crowd you on all sides. Ahead, in the focus of the movement, is a rock platform.
Z
Time passes...  The crowd around you begins to sway and groan. They are expecting something. You are drawn forward by the noise.  At Platform You stand before a low rock platform, more like an afterthought of piled rocks or a glacial moraine than a work of artifice. You are pushed against the pile by the crowd around you.  One small stone stands out in the pile, smooth, shiny, and glowing with a blazing light.
GET STONE
Taken.  Suddenly, the dimness becomes darkness, and the crowd around you explodes with excitement. You are jostled and shoved from all sides. A low keening begins, building into a deafening, almost mechanical chant. The darkness before you compacts and deepens.
Z
Time passes...  The darkness before you, now visible, is a creature. It towers over the now silent crowd. The thing jerks this way and that, spraying a foul ichor. Its palps twitch expectantly, then pound impatiently against the rock. You can feel the smooth stone vibrating in your hand.
Z
Time passes...  The thing now turns, sensing the presence of the stone. It quests almost blindly for it, then those surrounding you thrust you forward. The thing stoops, its mandibles grasping you. You are lifted towards its gaping maw. The stench and the sounds issuing from it are overwhelming, and you fall unconscious.  You are awakened by the thump of your head hitting the terminal in front of you. Falling asleep over term papers! It must have been a nightmare. Embarrassed, you glance around. Yes, the hacker is looking in your direction. He must have heard the thump.  Terminal Room, on the chair  A really whiz bang pc is right inside the door.  Sitting at a terminal is a hacker whom you recognize.
STAND UP
You get out of the chair.  The hacker wanders over, trying to look nonchalant. "Losing, huh?" he asks wittily. He glances at your terminal, which displays a pattern of snow and unusual characters. He appears somewhat excited.
Z
Time passes...  The hacker, mumbling under his breath, begins a flurry of activity. First the screen returns to something nearly normal, then windows begin popping up like toadstools after a rain. The screen looks a lot like the top of his terminal table (or the bottom of a trash can).
Z
Time passes...  The hacker types furiously, and the screen displays what to you looks like an explosion in a teletype factory. After a while he says. "Chomping file system. Your directory has gone seriously west. I fixed it." He checks the screen. "It was mixed up on the file server with some files from the Department of Alchemy." He grunts. "People's names for their nodes are getting weird. This one is called 'Lovecraft.'" He pauses. "Your paper is gone, though. Sorry. Maybe they could help you down there."
Z
Time passes...  The hacker wanders back to his terminal and returns to his hacking.

The cord leads to a large floor waxer.
U
Great Dome Here a walkway circles the base of a huge ornate dome. Below is the Infinite Corridor. From stories of Tech Exploring trips, you recall that there is supposed to be a ladder here. On the other hand, there is a shiny rope like thing hanging near where the ladder used to be, and leading upward. Below you, in the corridor, you can see a floor waxer, busily waxing the floor.
CLIMB ROPE
The wet stuff on the strand sticks to the gloves, but doesn't otherwise affect you. You have a little trouble climbing up to the catwalk, but grab the rail just before your strength gives out. You heave yourself up onto the catwalk.  You stand up on the catwalk, catching your breath for a moment. Your eyes stray along the strand you climbed. It trails along the catwalk, where it joins something large and squishy squatting at the far side. A single, bright blue eye opens in the squishy mass, and the tentacle (for that's what it is) retracts. The mass almost flows through the spaces in the catwalk railing and drops to the floor fifteen feet below. Before you can react, it's gone.  Top of Dome Inside the great dome, near the top, a metal catwalk is precariously perched. There is no way further up, but a small metal door is set in the side of the dome.  Where the pulpy mass was squatting, a wooden ladder lies on the catwalk.
LOWER LADDER
You lower the ladder to the walkway below. It's just the right length to climb down.

You scramble up icy surface of the dome, almost slipping a few times, but finally you make it to the top.  On the Great Dome This is the very top of the Great Dome, a favorite place for Tech fraternities to install cows, Volkswagen Beetles, giant birthday candles, and other bizarre objects. The top is flat, round, and about five feet in diameter. It's very windy, which has kept the snow from accumulating here. The only way off is down.  In the exact center of the flat area is a bronze plug.  Bitter, bone cracking cold assaults you continuously. The temperature and the blizzard conditions are both horrible.

You pull off the seal and open the container, revealing a smelly, viscous liquid.  The maintenance man, growling foul sounding imprecations, descends from the floor waxer and heads towards you.
POUR WAX ON FLOOR
It pours out and spreads like ants at a picnic. The floor is now covered from wall to wall with slippery floor wax.  The maintenance man lurches toward you with surprising speed. Just as he is about to grab you he slips on the wax. His hand whips by, inches from your throat, and he drops to the floor, screaming in frustration.

U
Inside Dome You are inside a large domed area. The dome contains equipment that makes it clear it is a weather observation station. For some reason, it also contains a small peach tree.

You knock on the door. The hollow sound reverberates down the hall. You sort of wish you had knocked more softly.
Z
Time passes...  The door opens partway, revealing a professorial man in a white lab coat. He smiles. "Good evening! I don't get many visitors this late. You're not one of my students, are you?" He ushers you into the room without waiting for an answer, closing the door behind you.  Department of Alchemy This office is clinically clean, shiny, and modern. It looks like something out of a science fiction movie. A closed door to the north leads back into the corridor and an archway opens to the south.  Taped to the wall to the right of the archway is a sign up sheet.  The professor is here.
GIVE PAPER TO PROFESSOR
He reads it carefully. "What drivel! This just confirms my suspicions. He had clearly gone over the edge. Drug use, drinking, insanity. It's only too bad that I didn't realize what was happening. I might have helped him."  The professor gazes at you with a distinctly predatory air.
S
"Ah! You'd like to see the lab?" the professor asks in a rather unctuous tone. "Come right in!" He ushers you through the archway into the lab, following quickly behind you and turning on the lights.  Lab The lab is an ultramodern, fully equipped chemistry lab. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, you aren't a chemistry major, so the equipment might as well be magical.  The professor is here.  There is a lab bench and an Alchemy Department computer here. Sitting on the lab bench is a vat. The vat contains a tarry liquid.  The professor guides you to the center of the lab, where a strange pentagonal symbol is chalked on the floor. He cuts one of the chalk lines with a small knife you had not previously noticed, pushes you into the center of the chalked symbol, and redraws the line, muttering softly and rhythmically as he does so. "There, that's done. Don't move from there, it'll only make things worse for you." He makes some odd gestures at the archway and then goes over to the lab bench.
Z
Time passes...  The professor is preparing something at the lab bench. "Alchemy is my chosen field, and I've gotten ridiculed for it. It's like chemistry, except that chemists don't recognize that some natural laws are enforced by persons, not physics. Some of them will grant power, or knowledge, but they must be placated, or even bribed. They're not of this earth, not demons or devils, and they aren't always friendly. To me it's just an unpleasant necessity on the path to power. When I'm done, they won't laugh anymore!"
Z
Time passes...  The professor enters another pentagram, and begins a highly choreographed ritual. "This may seem a little silly to you, but the symbology is what's important. Certain alignments, certain aspects. In a few moments, it won't matter anyway," he remarks. "There is very little room for error here, so be calm." He chants, he brandishes strange instruments, moves about inside the pentagram, and occasionally points to you. It becomes clear exactly what he meant by the word "bribe."
CUT LINE WITH KNIFE
You cut the outer lines of the pentagram. It no longer completely encloses you. The professor sees what you've done out of the corner of his eye. He stares, horrified. "Stop, don't move!" he says between verses of the chant. The chant takes on a pleading tone.  The chant grows more complex, the professor having difficulty with the almost unpronounceable words, with rhythms and cadences that make you want to stop your ears. The room appears to be getting darker.
GET OUT OF PENTAGRAM
You push your way through a soft spot just over the scuff marks, and are outside the pentagram. The air is thick and close.  A thick black mist begins to form in the room. Parts are darker, and parts lighter, and the dark parts form a disturbing shape. The professor chants and calls more loudly now, clearly terrified of what may happen, and you realize the calls are being answered.
MOVE BENCH
It's heavy, but it moves, revealing a hinged metal trapdoor beneath.  The room is now freezing cold, though the windows are shuttered and tightly curtained. Low, bone rattling vibrations shake the room in cadence with the chant. The black mist is growing thicker. The professor is alternately looking at you and at the mist.
OPEN TRAPDOOR
It swings open easily.  The black mist swirls wildly around the room, and a deep bass voice gibbers out of thin air. "No!" screams the professor, and jumps toward you out of his own pentagram. He realizes what he has done, and tries to reenter, but the mist grabs at him.

When you dip the mummified hand in the liquid, the elixir begins to bubble furiously. You can't really see the hand, except when a finger pokes up every so often.  The hand bobs to the surface. It's odd, but it looked like one of the fingers moved.

Tomb This is a tiny, narrow, ill fitting room. It appears to have been a left over space from the joining of two preexisting buildings. It is roughly coffin shaped. The walls are covered by decades of overlaid graffiti, but there is one which is painted in huge fluorescent letters that were apparently impossible for later artists to completely deface. On the floor is a rusty access hatch locked with a huge padlock.

The lock, though rusty and unwilling, opens, releasing the hatch.

The hatch is heavy, and its hinges are rusty, but you pull and strain and it opens with a scream of metal. Revealed below is a rusty ladder leading down. Warm, fetid air coils up out of the hole. There is a burned out (no, smashed) utility light set in the wall a few feet down.

Steam Tunnel This dank and grimy tunnel is largely filled with an imperfectly insulated steam pipe. The tunnel is uncomfortably hot and damp. You have gone from the arctic to the tropics. The concrete tunnel has odd molds and fungi growing on its walls and ceiling, and the floor is squishy. Torn clots of insulation litter the floor. Along the ceiling runs a thick tangle of coaxial cable. The tunnel heads east and west. A rusty metal ladder leads up.  You can hear, in the distance, a chittering, scratching sound.
E
Steam Tunnel This dank and grimy tunnel is largely filled with an imperfectly insulated steam pipe. The tunnel is uncomfortably hot and damp. A thick bundle of coaxial cable runs east to west along the ceiling. There is a pressure release valve on the steam pipe here.  The sound is louder. It sounds like small animals. Is it rats?
TURN VALVE WITH CROWBAR
The valve, with a horrible scream of tortured metal, gives a little, and a small trickle of steam issues forth.  The sound continues. It's almost certainly rats.

TURN VALVE
The valve screeches open. A jet spray of live steam issues from it, filling the tunnel in front of you. The rats are caught in the full force of the blast. Horrible squeals can be heard from the midst of the steam cloud, and scalded rats charge past you, all interest in anything but flight forgotten. One of their number remains, dead.
CLOSE VALVE
The valve closes, more easily than it opened.
E
Steam Tunnel The steam tunnel is narrow here, and its construction is more archaic. It's now mostly brick, although the floor is concrete. The steam pipe and coaxial cable continue along their appointed paths. The tunnel is damp and even a little muddy.
E
Steam Tunnel The steam pipe and coaxial cable turn upwards and disappear into the ceiling here. The tunnel itself comes to an end in a grimy, damp, and dripping triad of crumbling brick walls. The south wall looks particularly decrepit.

The wall grudgingly yields to your efforts. A brick, less well mortared than its fellows, pulls out of the wall.
REMOVE NEW BRICK WITH CROWBAR
The wall grudgingly yields to your efforts. A brick, less well mortared than its fellows, drops to the floor on the other side, making a hole through the wall. You can see a rusty steel reinforcing rod in the hole.  A loud mechanical whining is audible through the hole.

Steam Tunnel This dank and grimy tunnel is largely filled with an imperfectly insulated steam pipe. The tunnel is uncomfortably hot and damp. A bundle of coaxial cable runs along the ceiling, festooned with damp mold and cobwebs. The tunnel continues west.
W
Tunnel Entrance The tunnel continues west from here, becoming narrow, muddy, and forbidding. The walls no longer seem to be as finished as they were. The steam pipe and coaxial cable disappear into the ceiling at this point. The temperature has dropped considerably, as well.
D
Muddy Tunnel The tunnel you came through continues down, barely large enough to enter. It is made of sticky gelatinous mud that's been pushed by something into a semblance of a passage.
D
Large Chamber This is a wide spot in the tunnel, just as wet and muddy as elsewhere. The walls are slimy as well. Numerous slots or indentations about two feet wide and a foot high open here and there. Thin, wire or ropelike growths emerge from a hole further down and enter each of the slots. There is background noise here, almost loud enough to hear clearly.  A small, furtive motion attracts your attention to the slots.
CUT GROWTH WITH CUTTER
You strain and push the two handles of the bolt cutter together with all your strength. At first it looks like nothing will happen, but then, with a loud click, the jaws cut the wire!  The wire, as though under tension, rapidly begins to curl up, disappearing down the tunnel and away. Urchins burst forth from the slots. The effect on the urchins is electric (perhaps literally). They twitch, jerk spasmodically, and fall to the ground almost in unison. They have lost all interest in you.
D
A few of the urchins grab feebly at you as you pass, but none is a serious barrier.  Wet Tunnel You are lost in narrow, wet tunnels burrowed through the mud. Muddy, oily water covers the floor.  The hand points its mutilated ring finger north and grips your shoulder tightly.

OPEN FLASK
You open the flask, and a cold, white mist boils out.
LOOK IN IT
The metal flask contains a cold liquid.
POUR LIQUID ON SLIME
The liquid splashes onto the curtain, and a cold mist fills the room. The slime begins to freeze. Nearly the entire curtain solidifies, shatters, and drops to the ground, revealing an ancient wooden door.
UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY
The door is now unlocked.  The mist dissipates.
OPEN DOOR
Okay, the ancient door is now open.
S
As you enter, the door closes and locks behind you.  Inner Lair The floor here is a stagnant, slime infested pool of water. It feels to be about six inches deep. Ropes or wires tumble down the slope, where they enter a large whitish mass which takes up much of the chamber. The noise is loud here, and comes from the mass, which undulates in synchrony with the noise. Wan, sourceless light illuminates the chamber.  Set on the wall, incongruous in its surroundings, is a metal box. On one side a coaxial cable enters the box. On the other, a cablelike appendage leads from the box to the mass. There is a metal cover on the box.  Suddenly, the hand leaps from your shoulder into the slime encrusted puddle. It dives beneath the water.
REACH INTO POOL
You root around blindly in the gooey, slimy water. You feel something thick and slippery! A tentacle? No, it's cold and dead. It seems to be a line of some kind, just below the surface.  You hear noises outside the door.
PULL LINE
You pull a length of the line out of the water. It's like holding a large, heavy snake.  You hear a stumbling noise behind you, turn and see the hacker staggering into the cavern.  The hacker stares at you, shocked. "It's you! When I gave you my key, I never suspected you'd get this far!"
CUT LINE WITH AXE
You strike the line with the axe, making a deep gash in the insulation.  The hacker stares at the thing in the cave. "I got very suspicious about your problems with the net. I began to trace some coax, found some repeaters and bridges that weren't on the layout charts, and started following them. Anyway, here I am. That thing there, whatever it is, and those wires, are interfaced to the whole campus net. And that means it's tied into all the nets, commercial, government, even military, potentially."
AGAIN
Your blow cuts through more insulation and into the conductors.  "I guess I better do something. It could be a serious compromise of system integrity if this thing isn't dealt with." He peers at the mass, as if evaluating it. He then reaches into a pocket and pulls out a small pair of wire strippers.
AGAIN
The line parts! The two ends begin to sink towards the water as they straighten out.  The hacker advances on the mass, apparently planning to cut some of the wires leading into it. As he approaches it, the sound stops completely, and the wires begin a frantic, looping, twining dance. The mass begins to flow towards the hacker almost as quickly as he walks toward it. They reach each other and begin to merge together. He screams; a long, ululating cry that echoes through the cavern. Then he is engulfed.
GET LINE
You carefully grab the line just as it's about to drop into the water.  The mass is bulging, vibrating, and rippling.
OPEN METAL COVER
You remove the cover, revealing a plethora of electronic innards. Most prominent are a socket into which the coaxial cable is plugged, and a connector into which the glistening cablelike appendage disappears.  The mass is bulging, vibrating, and rippling.
UNPLUG COAXIAL CABLE
You unscrew the cable. It now hangs unconnected inside the box.  The mass is bulging, vibrating, and rippling. A huge tear is forming near where the hacker was absorbed.
PUT LINE IN SOCKET
You shove the exposed conductors into the socket, producing a shower of sparks! The tentacle connected to the other socket begins to jerk and twitch spasmodically. The mass it's connected to quivers, and a horrible noise, almost like a huge machine running without oil, issues from the thing.  The mass begins to change shape, compacting, darkening. You can briefly see human outlines within the grey, gelatinous mass. They surround something larger, of a shape not human, not animal, like nothing you've seen before.  The gelatinous mass solidifies and compacts, leaving behind a litter of smoking debris. In the debris squats a being. Huge, misshapen, it stares at you with baleful yellow eyes. Its scaly wings beat slowly, driving a fetid stench through the stale air of the cavern. A barbed tongue slides across its broken, daggerlike fangs.  The smooth stone vibrates. It starts to feel warm.
Z
Time passes...  The thing tenses, preparing to leap. Its mouth opens, revealing not the glistening interior, but a dead black outline like a hole into nothingness.  The smooth stone is now glowing with a bright red heat that nevertheless fails to burn you.
THROW STONE AT THING
The stone smashes into the creature, sticking to its ichorous hide. The thing thrashes about, trying to bite at the stone, which is glowing brighter and brighter. Small hands issue from beneath its scales to tug in vain at the irritant. The creature begins to show gaping holes of dark, light devouring nothingness around the stone. Its wings spread painfully, as though it were trying to fly away, and then fold. It widens its jaw in an almost human scream of agony. The black hole of its maw overwhelms it, and indeed the creature appears to be swallowing itself. At last, a grey cloud of greasy smoke surrounds the glowing stone, still suspended in midair. Then even that vanishes, and the stone drops to the ground, no longer glowing. The thing is gone.

Edge of Chasm The road ends suddenly at a wide chasm. The road leads upward to the north, and you can see it continuing on the southern side of the chasm.  Lying in a tight coil at the edge of the chasm is a hissing snake.  The snake appears to be curled around a featureless white cube.

Fifth Layer of the Earth's Crust Endless dark and foreboding passages surround you on all sides. You're cold, tired, and that musty smell in the air has really started getting to you lately. Spelunking seemed much more romantic when you first agreed to accept the mission for the Jewel. Untold riches, fame, glory; it seemed so perfect. Now you're a month into the expedition with little to show for it except for a few rock samples and the death of a party member. You're deep inside the fifth layer of the Earth's crust, surrounded by tight shafts and ominous pits. You are quickly descending to the sixth and final layer; the resting place of the fabled Jewel.  Your good friend and fellow campaigner Jacob is here. He slowly scuttles through the underground by your side.

Gaseous Geyser In the centre of this room sits a perfectly round hole with vapor slowly sifting from it. A large shaft, the top of which can't be seen in the dim light, heads up through the ceiling. The vapor from the hole slowly trickles up a porous, cratered wall to the west and finally up through the shaft. The ground here trembles softly.
x porous wall
The porous west wall is made up of a very textured and crumbly piece of granite. The wall has not aged well over time, and being placed in such an extreme environment hasn't made things any easier. Small pieces crumble off as the ground lightly trembles. Big and small holes all over the wall lead right up through the shaft into darkness.  You can feel a slight rumbling beneath your feet.

On the Ledge You're standing on the nearby ledge. Although it seems fairly stable, you don't want to spend too much time here.  Oh, the horror! Lying face down on the cold granite ledge is your former colleague Ariana! Looking up through the shaft, you deduce that this must have been the air pocket she fell through a few layers up. The good thief (and your good friend) is completely motionless, and it occurs to you that you have never seen her in one place without moving for such a long period of time. You feel a lump in your throat as you realise that your nimble friend won't be around to experience the joy of your triumph as you bring home the Jewel. Bowing your head, you pray to the gods to watch over her.

Ariana is turned face down on the ledge. You know it's her by her customary outfit. She is wearing her signature leather boots, a scarlet sash around her waist, and a loaded crossbow over one shoulder. Poor Ariana. You're glad you saw her this one last time to say goodbye.  That shaft walls vibrate a bit and you hear a distant rumbling.
x boots
Ariana's boots are made from some of the finest cured leather you've ever seen. Their sleek fit is disturbed by a bulge in Ariana's left boot.  In an instant a stream of sulfurous water shoots past you, 100 feet up the shaft. The water comes crashing back down in a torrent and sprays you in the process.

A worn label on the air bladder reads as follows:  BIG AL'S AIR BLADDER CO.  Producing the finest leather bladders since before you can remember!  WARNING  Please remember that the air bladder will only serve as a LIMITED air supply. Once you've opened it, you've lost the use of the air bladder as a flotation device and a future air supply.

The room temperature here is obviously below zero and you can see your own breath as you tremble across the frozen landscape. A tight passage leads northwest, and another smaller cavern can be seen to the south.  Lying against one of the walls is an ENORMOUS white dragon. This must be one of the fabled dragons written about in Amylyan legend. It's eyes are currently closed. Maybe it's sleeping. What a stroke of luck that would be!
x dragon
The White Dragon stretches out almost 15 meters long, and has white silvery scales. Besides this you notice that its mighty clawed hands are clenched tightly, its mouth is partially open revealing gruesome white fangs, its tail lies curled like a fine hemp rope, and its eyes are closed shut (lucky for you)!
look in mouth
A thought crosses your mind and you open the dragon's mouth and listen patiently. What you don't hear is more interesting than what you do hear. The dragon isn't breathing. This is unbelievable! You've traveled so far thinking you would have to face three fearsome dragons, and this one's died of natural causes before you had the chance! (That's not to say you're complaining.)

read book
You flip through the book and come to the section on the fabled dragons of the sixth layer. It states that there are three fearsome dragons in this part of the underworld that must be challenged before the Jewel can be obtained.  The first is the White Dragon, which lives in a cold and icy lair. His deadliest weapon is a cone of frost that can freeze an entire army dead in their tracks. He is the oldest and wisest of the dragons.  The Black Dragon is another fearsome opponent. His breath weapon is a stream of acid that can corrode the toughest of metals, not to mention bone and skin. The oracles have sensed that he is a rather lazy dragon and is content to count his baubles rather than concern himself with otherworldly affairs.  The final dragon, and fabled keeper of the Jewel, is the fearsome Red Dragon. She is the strongest of the dragons and breathes an indefensible blast of fire which will incinerate anything it touches. The Red Dragon is merciless. She will always prefer to attack first and ask questions later (if there's anyone left to answer).  Although these dragons have never been viewed, the oracles are reasonably sure of these facts because of years of meditation and mystical incantations. They also seem certain that reaching the Red Dragon's lair by "conventional" methods (if this is in fact possible) will require overcoming three separate hurdles.
ask allarah about white
"Timbork, the White Dragon, has been a bit of a mystery to us of late. Recently, our druids have had trouble sensing his life forces and pinpointing his exact whereabouts. Quite peculiar indeed."
ask allarah about black
"Rasha, the Black Dragon, lies warily playing with his many baubles and trinkets. He prefers to keep to himself, and as far as we can tell lies barricaded behind a strong locked door. We are not certain, but we believe that this door can only be unlocked with an ebony key which is possessed by Rasha himself. Through extensive praying and meditation, we have envisioned the key's shape and appearance. Based on our druids' visions, our blacksmiths have made a copy and we would like you to have it."  Allarah hands you a heavy ebony key.  "Furthermore, we feel that once Rasha is finally confronted, he can be brought into conversation out of sheer boredom. Like all dragons, Rasha is quite powerful. However, don't let his bravado fool you: Rasha is a coward at heart and will do just about anything to save himself."  [Your score has just gone up by three points.]
ask allarah about red
"Helspeth, the Red Dragon, will present you with many problems. We have sensed through prayer that approaching her lair by any straightforward method is IMPOSSIBLE! As a result, you'll have to find some other approach. Being the guardian of the fabled Jewel, she will kill without any pretenses. As another security measure, the Jewel is not located directly in her chamber but rather in an antechamber that is only accessible by water."
ask allarah about jewel
"Ah yes, the Jewel of Knowledge. You will find it in Helspeth the Red Dragon's lair. If you succeed in your mission, you will have the powers of the strongest mage and the omniscience of a god!"  Hearing it put that way, you feel a sudden sense of hubris working its way out of your bowels. Omniscience and unlimited power are better suited to those celestial beings that have had eternities to master their abilities. Is it right for a mortal to wield such power? Is it safe? Was it worth Jacob's life, not to mention Ariana's? You know the answer to that last question must be "YES".  So why are you having such a tough time convincing yourself?

The floor here is made of polished stone, which is quite uncommon in the underground. The room is quite tidy and you marvel at the fact that there isn't any dust! A passage leads off to the east and a rocky ramp leads up to the southeast.  A Black Dragon the size of a small temple is playing with a little trinket in the corner of this room. He notices your entry and a slow grin spreads across his face.  "Well, hello there. I haven't had company for over a century. Let me guess. You're a freelance scribe, and you're looking to write my autobiography."  "No, you're not wearing spectacles and you're too muscular."  "Could you be a new servant? Sent here to do my bidding?"  "Probably not. That fire in your eyes is unbecoming of paid help."  "I've got it! You're here in search of treasure and adventure. Maybe a tussle with the great Black Dragon or a scavenger hunt through his treasure room." he says with a quick glance to the east.  He spins a little trinket on his finger and his visage becomes much more menacing. "Why don't you stay a while?" The obsidian door behind you slams shut. "I'd love to have you for dinner."

"I keep to myself. I spend my days admiring my treasures, relaxing, and eating the occasional dragonslayer." He grins and eyes you menacingly.  The Black Dragon stares alternately at you and his little trinket.
ask dragon about red
"I think Helspeth would prefer that I don't talk about her. She's a very private dragon."  "Apparently, there has been an anti dragon sentiment building up in the kingdom of RAIF." The dragon looks somewhat disturbed and says, "Eat a few princesses, and they never let you forget."
ask dragon about jewel
"How do you know about that?" the Black Dragon says, looking quite alarmed. "That is our family jewel and you will never have it!"  The Black Dragon appears to be getting quite aggravated.  The Black Dragon flaps his wings and the current nearly knocks you over.
read book
You flip through the book and come to the section on the fabled dragons of the sixth layer. It states that there are three fearsome dragons in this part of the underworld that must be challenged before the Jewel can be obtained.  The first is the White Dragon, which lives in a cold and icy lair. His deadliest weapon is a cone of frost that can freeze an entire army dead in their tracks. He is the oldest and wisest of the dragons.  The Black Dragon is another fearsome opponent. His breath weapon is a stream of acid that can corrode the toughest of metals, not to mention bone and skin. The oracles have sensed that he is a rather lazy dragon and is content to count his baubles rather than concern himself with otherworldly affairs.  The final dragon, and fabled keeper of the Jewel, is the fearsome Red Dragon. She is the strongest of the dragons and breathes an indefensible blast of fire which will incinerate anything it touches. The Red Dragon is merciless. She will always prefer to attack first and ask questions later (if there's anyone left to answer).  Although these dragons have never been viewed, the oracles are reasonably sure of these facts because of years of meditation and mystical incantations. They also seem certain that reaching the Red Dragon's lair by "conventional" methods (if this is in fact possible) will require overcoming three separate hurdles.  The Black Dragon yawns in apparent boredom.
x lye
Lye is a "base" ic, industrial strength cleaner that can actually be quite corrosive if ingested.  The Black Dragon looks into the room to the east then back at you.
x coat
You've read about rare coats such as this from magical textbooks. The proper name for this coat is a "coat of many colors", and it's an extremely powerful magic item! The magic comes from the coat's ability to take on all the properties of any inventory item that you possess. You can do this by inserting any item that you have into the coat. The coat will "absorb" the item into its fibers and will then be made up of all the properties that the original inventory item was made up of. So, for example, if you inserted a piece of steel into the coat, the magic would produce a full length coat made of steel (not bad if you need some armor quickly and can't afford to buy it).  Be cautious, however, the coat can only absorb one time (it would take an incredible amount of power to rip the original item from the coat's fibers), and once an item has been absorbed, it's lost forever.  "I remember when the underground used to be bubbling with life. The goblin horde was in charge of excavation, the kobolds made capable servants, and the orcs provided security. I must have eaten an adventurer twice your size every day." The dragon salivates a bit as he stares in your direction.
put lye in coat
You insert your lye into the "coat of many colors" and the coat instantly changes texture and color to match that of the lye. You now have a coat composed of the elements that made up your lye.  "So have you run into Timbork the White Dragon yet? Obviously not. There wouldn't be much left of you if you had. He can be somewhat uncivilized at times. Unlike myself of course..."

Time passes.  The Black Dragon yawns in apparent boredom.
z
Time passes.  "I've had enough of your annoying presence. It's been a while since I've had the pleasure of eating a meddlesome adventurer." With that, the dragon opens his mouth and spews forth gallons and gallons of corrosive acid! The acid splashes onto your coat, and much to your relief, doesn't corrode through. The lye in your coat is a strong base and the acid is effectively negated by the power of the lye. When the dragon finally stops spraying, you're left standing in a puddle of salt and water (the two products created when an acid is mixed with a base).  The dragon's expression is one of shock: "How in the world did you survive the blast?"  You've successfully negated his acid attack, but his claws and tail still look like potential threats.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]
attack dragon with sword
The dragon is still in shock after witnessing your resistance to his acid. You catch the dragon in a rare moment of confusion and run forward to attack it. You swing your trusty sword as hard as you can and chop off one of the dragon's claws! Unfortunately you shatter your sword in the process. The dragon screams in pain as the claw dissolves into a mucky goo.  The dragon convulses in pain as blue black blood spews from its severed claw.  [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

At the Top of the Ramp You've scrambled up onto the apex of the ramp. Unfortunately it's a dead end, and the only means of escape is back down the ramp. Huge boulders sit precariously on this ledge. Through the boulders you can see the Black Dragon, nursing his severed arm, and looking up at you while plotting his next move.  [Your score has just gone up by two points.]
push boulders
What a great idea! You put your shoulder into pushing one of the boulders over the ledge. Because of the boulder's weight, this normally would be next to impossible. But because these boulders are positioned on the edge of the ledge, a gentle nudge is all they need! After a few seconds, you manage to push one of the bigger boulders off the ledge. It rubs another boulder on its descent and starts a chain reaction avalanche that can't be stopped. When the dust settles, there are no boulders left on the ledge and the Black Dragon lies trapped under tons and tons of rock!  [Your score has just gone up by three points.]

Black Dragon's Lair  The humbled dragon lies under a ton of rock and debris. His soft cushiony head and one clenched claw are all that are visible in the pile.

You put on the ring of heat resistance.  The Black Dragon surveys his surroundings.
dragon, open door
"Yes, of course. I'll let you free. Just, please leave me alone." And with that the dragon mumbles a few words and the obsidian door to the west opens wide!  The dragon looks directly at you. He checks over all of your possessions and his gaze becomes transfixed on your crossbow. He seems to be getting a little nervous.
ask dragon about jewel
The dragon ponders your question, looks at your crossbow and says, "The Jewel is protected by Helspeth, the Red Dragon. If you agree to spare my life I will take you to her. Reaching her lair by any conventional methods is impossible. You will have to sit on my head as I take you through a secret passage."  The dragon looks directly at you. He checks over all of your possessions and his gaze becomes transfixed on your crossbow. He seems to be getting a little nervous.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]
sit on dragon
You cautiously climb the dragon's scaly face, and sit on the cushiony part between its ears. You aim the crossbow at the dragon's head just in case it tries something. Needless to say, you're a little nervous. The dragon picks itself out of the rubble and heads east.  Black Dragon's Antechamber Your eyes bug out as you enter this room. There's gold to the right of you, silver to the left, and all sorts of unimaginable treasures just waiting to be discovered.  You're sitting on top of the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon hobbles around, with only three of its four major appendages still intact.  A platinum bar sticks out amongst the scattered treasures.  A piece of paper with some intricate writing on it can be seen on the floor.  A featureless white cube lies tucked away under some bullion.  A copper statue leans up against one of the walls.

Time passes.  Without warning, the Black Dragon takes to the sky. He heads right for the ceiling and in fear you close your eyes and brace yourself for impact. After a few moments pass without pain, you reopen your eyes.  The ceiling must have been an illusion. The dragon is now standing in an expansive east west passage!   Well Lit Passage The huge passage runs east west and phosphorescent mosses keep it well lit. This tunnel was apparently professionally carved out of molten rock. You can tell because of the exactness of the angles and the evenness of the floor and walls.  You're sitting on top of the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon hobbles around, with only three of its four major appendages still intact.
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon sniffs the floor, looks east and then west.

Time passes.  The Black Dragon hobbles on to the west.  Steep Cliff Face The east west passage ends at a steep cliff face made of black stone. The cliff falls a good twenty or thirty feet, but there appear to be a number of handholds leading down the face.  You're sitting on top of the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon hobbles around, with only three of its four major appendages still intact.

Time passes.  The Black Dragon looks over the edge of the cliff.

Time passes.  The Black Dragon spreads his wings and glides down to the base of the cliff.  Red Dragon Gate In front of you stands a huge gate made of solid lava. The gate bears the insignia of a mighty lizard engulfed in flame. This must be the home of the Red Dragon! You can also see a cliff face that leads up and to the east.  You're sitting on top of the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon hobbles around, with only three of its four major appendages still intact.
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon touches the insignia on the gate with his one good paw.
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon says some words under his breath and the lava gate opens!
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon cautiously proceeds through the door to the west.  Red Dragon's Lair This is it: the final confrontation. You find yourself in a hollowed out piece of pure magma. The air smells of sulfur dioxide and you cough lightly as you breathe it in. A river of lava can be seen through a gap to the south and a river of water flows to the north. A narrow strip of land divides the two rivers as the room continues west to a plateau over which a wooden chandelier hangs.  The Black Dragon takes a few tentative steps into the room and then freezes.  Covering the entire west wall at the end of this cavern is the beautiful Red Dragon. She looks at you with anger and disdain.  "Rasha! Why have you brought this human into my inner ssssanctum!" screams the Red Dragon.  "Helspeth, please I beg your forgiveness, I had no choi " whimpers the Black Dragon, but he is quickly cut off.  "Ssssilence! Dispose of this human immediately!" screams the Red Dragon.  With that, Rasha throws you off his head. Awestruck by the sheer size of the mighty Red Dragon, you are unable to react. You fall on the ground and get up to see the Black Dragon staring at you menacingly.  [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

On The Divide You are midway between the entrance to this cave and the plateau that the Red Dragon currently sits on. To the south flows a river of lava, while to the north flows a river of water. To the east you see the Black Dragon limping in anticipation and to the west you see the mighty Red Dragon sitting under her chandelier, looking increasingly agitated.
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon and Red Dragon look directly at each other. They stare for half a minute and then focus their attentions on you!
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon peers at you and opens his mouth.
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon spews forth his corrosive black acid, and it splatters all over your coat of many colors. This dragon must have taken one too many blows to the head. That trick didn't work the first time. Did he think it would work a second time?
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon continues to spew forth his acid. The copious amounts of acid coming into contact with the lye in your coat are creating gallons and gallons of water that seep directly into the river to the north. Out of the corner of your eye, you notice the water levels in the river getting quite high.
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon must be exhausting his lifetime supply of acid, as he continues to spray you with the black goo. The reaction with the lye is again creating more water and the river level continues to rise to the north. The Red Dragon appears to have had enough. She opens her mouth in preparation.
z
Time passes.  The Black Dragon, exhausted of his acid supply, slumps over by the east wall. Unfortunately, you get no respite from the attack. The Red Dragon breathes in, and blows out a huge fireball that engulfs the entire chamber, including you and the Black Dragon. The blast sends shudders through the cavern and small cracks begin to appear by the eastern wall from which the river flows. Fortunately, you're wearing your heat resistant ring and suffer no ill effects!
z
Time passes.  The Red Dragon increases the intensity of the fireball. The flame turns from a bright orange yellow to a deep red. You don't feel the heat from the blast, but the sheer force of the fireball almost knocks you over! The cracks around the river's east wall grow bigger and chunks of rock start to fall into the river.
z
Time passes.  The Red Dragon lets loose with every ounce of energy that she has. The flame turns from a deep red to a bright blue! The intensity from the blast is so strong, that it knocks some of your possessions out of your hands and into the river, while incinerating others. All of this despite the fact that your ring should protect you and your possessions from the heat. You can also feel a tingling in your jacket as you realise that the lye is being ripped from your coat! You stare at the coat incredulously as it reverts back to the way you found it in the White Dragon's lair.  The eastern wall from which the river flows finally gives way under the combined pressure of the heat and the higher water levels in the river. The eastern part of the room begins to flood, and the badly burned and exhausted Black Dragon gets caught up in the overpowering current and is swept away. Once the Red Dragon stops breathing her flame, she collapses, having expended almost all of her energy.  [Your score has just gone up by ten points.]

Red Dragon's Plateau A huge piece of molten rock juts out here, forming the plateau that the Red Dragon usually lies on. A river of lava can be seen to the south and a river of water to the north. High up above the plateau hangs a beautiful wooden chandelier.  The Red Dragon is here trying to regain her second wind. She's struggling for breath at the moment.

x chandelier
The chandelier is a beautifully constructed piece of woodwork. The multi layered chandelier contains hundreds of candles and is attached to the ceiling by a sturdy hemp rope.  "All the power of a god... in the handsss of a mortal who hasss never known sssuch power... is extremely dangerousss. You would become uncontrollable and have free reign over all that you ssseee. You would upssset the balancccess of power in your world. Thisss would lead to ccivil unresst and either continued oppresssion or anarchy!"
shoot rope with crossbow
You aim at the rope connecting the chandelier to the ceiling and fire. It's a direct hit! You snap the rope in two and the chandelier comes crashing down on top of the exhausted dragon. Burning chunks of wood fly off the chandelier and the dragon can't defend herself against the falling debris. After it's all said and done, the dragon lies pinned under a mountain of wooden rubble.

Time passes.  The current becomes extremely violent in this area. You hold onto the air bladder with all of your remaining energy as you tumble through the dangerous rapids. The waves rush over you in a never ending torrent of water and pressure. There are times when you lose sight of the surface and are completely immersed by the black water, but you refuse to let go of the bladder. Just when you feel like you can't hold on to the bladder any longer, it gets swept out from underneath you and continues its journey down the river. Fortunately for you, the rough currents deposit you on a grainy beach, just north of the river.

Jewel Room Finally, after all you've been through, you've arrived! Outside of the two prominent objects in this room, there really isn't much to look at. The room is barren and cold. It certainly lacks the atmosphere that the previous halls had.  A long brass mirror stands upright at the far end of the hall.  A beautiful marble pedestal sits in the middle of the room.  On the pedestal is a radiant blue jewel.

"I'm in trouble," he says. "I had a few too many at The Shanty. I was looking for Red, but he wasn't around, and I started talking about ... here," he says, handing you a slim volume that you recognize as a shipwreck book written years ago by the Historical Society.  You smile. Every diver on the island has looked for those wrecks, without even an old boot to show for it. You open the door, hoping the drunken fool will leave. "I know what you're thinkin'," Hevlin scowls, "but look!" He points to the familiar map, and you see new locations marked for two of the wrecks.  "Keep it for me," he says. "Just for tonight. It'll be safe here with you. Don't let    " He stops and broods for a moment. "I've got to go find Red!" And with that, Hevlin leaves.  You put the book in your dresser and think about following Hevlin. Then you hear a scuffle outside. You look through your window and see two men struggling. One falls to the ground in a heap. The other man bends down beside him, then turns as if startled and runs away. Another man then approaches the wounded figure. He kneels beside him for a long moment, then takes off after the other man.  It isn't long before the police arrive to tell you that Hevlin's been murdered. You don't mention the book, and hours later, as you lie awake in your bed, you wonder if the book could really be what it seems.  CUTTHROATS Copyright (c) 1984 by Infocom, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Shanty This is The Shanty, a tavern which serves the locals. A wooden bar travels the length of the place, and behind it is a mirror so dirty, it offers no reflection. Round tables occupy the floor. The smell of cooking food permeates the place. A bartender behind the bar polishes glasses with a worn towel. A parrot with an eyepatch hobbles up and down the bar. A man wearing an eyepatch, black turtleneck, and jeans is standing about. He is known as Pete the Rat. Johnny Red is here. Red hair sprouts from his head and from beneath his flannel shirt. "Sit down and we'll talk," Johnny Red says.

They chose you because they know you've salted some money away and you're a great diver. He asks if you're interested in the deal.
yes
Johnny looks around and says, "This is no place to continue. If McGinty finds out about this, we're sunk. We better meet at the lighthouse at 9:30. Glad you're aboard."

"We'll need you to supply the minutes of longitude and latitude of the wreck. Get $500 and meet me at Point Lookout at 10:45. Then we'll provision the boat."  He turns to the others. "We'll meet in The Shanty at 11:45 to discuss final arrangements.  "We're all in this now," Johnny says to the group. "I'm not gonna chance this operation if one of you doesn't show.

Wharf You're on Hardscrabble Island's weatherbeaten wharf, north of the Wharf Road. A trawler called the Night Wind is berthed here to the west. The Mary Margaret is moored to the east. Pete the Rat walks along with you. The Outfitters' delivery boy heads off to the west, pushing his cart.
w
Starboard Deck You are on the starboard side of the Night Wind, a sturdy vessel designed for trawling. To port is a small wheelhouse, while to starboard is the gangway leading to the dock. The gentle rocking of the boat in port reminds you of time spent on the open sea. Pete the Rat walks along with you. The Outfitters' delivery boy heads aft, pushing his cart.

Aft Deck The smell of diesel fuel is strong but reassuring here on the aft deck. A ladder leads below deck, while forward you can see the entrance to the command center of the boat, the wheelhouse. Pete the Rat walks along with you. The Outfitters' delivery boy heads below, pushing his cart.

n
Galley You are in the Night Wind's galley. A stove and a small table are the fixtures here. Water is available. A ladder leads up through the deck to the wheelhouse for feeding the captain in rough weather. Pete the Rat arrives, quickly taking in the situation. The Outfitters' delivery boy heads forward, pushing his cart.
n
Crew's Quarters You are below deck in the crew's quarters. Narrow, uncomfortable bunks line the bulkheads, and you note the similarity between this area and a sardine can. Sleeping here is necessary but uninviting. A ladder leads up and out to the fore deck. The Outfitters' delivery boy heads forward, pushing his cart.
n
Storage Locker You are in a fairly empty storage locker. It must have been cleaned out after its last trawling expedition. There are spare parts for the engine and other equipment scattered about. There is a flashlight here. There is a shark repellent canister here. There is a C battery here. There is a tube of putty here. There is a portable electromagnet here. There is a small air compressor here. There is a portable drill here. The Outfitters' delivery boy heads aft, pushing his cart.

"Another thrilling day at Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School," you think, with studied irony, as you get off the bus, trying to look as cool and bored as the other eighth graders. In truth, though, you really are a little excited and nervous, because today is Valentine's Day, and you have a special job to do, delivering Enterprise Candy Grams to classes all around the building. And best (and worst) of all, your delivery partner will be Judy, on whom you've had an incredible crush since before you knew what a crush was.  You are Doug DeGrace, a lanky, thirteen year old eighth grade student at the only public school in Nom de Plume, North Dakota, a town of five thousand souls in the north central part of the United States, which boasts of being "The Coldest French Named Town in the EN tire US of A." Today's temperature does nothing to contradict the town's unofficial slogan.  As you enter the middle school side of the building, which is totally separate from the section for kids younger than ten, you see a huge red poster advertising the biggest social event of the year, the Valentine's Day Dance. The dance is tonight, but you're not at all sure you'll be going. After a quick trip to your locker, you arrive at the middle school cafeteria, where your school day starts.  The Enterprise Incidents A Middle School Fantasy  by Brendan Desilets Release 1 / Serial number 020428 / Inform v6.21 Library 6/10   The Cafe The Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.  Mr. Alltext enters the cafeteria from the west.  He's a small man in his fifties and is wearing a "Save the Children" tie.   "Hi!," he says. "It's good to see you're all on time. Here's the key to the closet, Doug." He gives you a brass key. "Judy will be working with you, and so will the new girl who's joining us today.  "Since you worked as a record keeper on our last candy gram project and Judy handled the actual deliveries, the two of you will swap those roles today.  The new girl will serve mainly as an observer.  "All the paperwork you'll need is on the shelf in the closet.  So are the cards and candy pops you'll be delivering. By the way, there are some unsold pops in the envelope.  Feel free to buy and deliver them, if you like."  "Any questions about your job today?"  Judy flops herself down on one of the cafeteria stools.  She's blond and pretty, and she's chewing a big wad of gum.  The new girl is known by the odd nickname "Queenie," or so you've been told.  She approaches you and Judy, limping a little. She seems quiet, but not especially shy or nervous. Queenie has a small scar on her cheek.   Judy raises her hand, even though only three students are in the area.  Mr. Alltext replies a bit ruefully, as if he's expecting something odd, "Yes, Judy."  "Can I go the bathroom?" Judy inquires.   Mr. Alltext pauses, collects himself for a moment, and replies, "I don't think that qualifies as a question about our special task for today, Judy, but I'll answer anyway. No. You may not. However, in a few minutes, you'll be on your own (Heaven help us!), delivering the candy grams, and so you'll be able to make your own hygienic choices."  "OK," she comments amiably.  (If this is your first experience with interactive fiction, you should probably now type INTRO.  If you've read other works of interactive fiction but are trying this one for the first time, you should probably type ABOUT.)  (If you need a hint for one of the story's puzzles, type HINT. To see a walkthru, type WALKTHRU.)  You can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. Alltext and a pastoral mural here.

"Your job is to deliver candy grams to the people on the list that you'll find in the Enterprise Closet.  It's important for you to be extremely courteous and quiet in the halls, to carry out your work as planned, and to keep complete records, as we've practiced.  Still, unexpected things can happen, and, of course, you'll have to use your own good judgment if they do."  "Since you'll have more candy grams than people to deliver to, you're free to buy some of the remaining grams, if you like, and to deliver them, if you can do so without disturbing any classes."  Mr. Alltext starts to leave the cafeteria to the west, but then he seems to remember something and turns to you.  "Oh, by the way, Doug.  Since you'll be in the halls a lot this period, Principal Drenaline would like you to serve as hall monitor.  There's not much to do.  Just make sure kids have hall passes and adults are wearing visitor passes, unless they work here, of course.  If anyone from outside the school doesn't have a visitor's badge, ask the person to go to the office to get one.  If a kid doesn't have a pass, send the person back to class to get one."  "Well," says Mr. Alltext, "I'll head for my classroom now.  You know where to find me if you need me."  "Remember, though, to be quiet in the halls and to avoid entering any classroom more than once.  Of course, that means you'll have to come to my class last, so that you can deliver to a student there and then tell me how things have gone."  "Also, don't forget to leave the closet door locked."  "And, Doug, remember to wear that hall monitor's badge."  Mr. Alltext leaves the cafeteria to the west.  "Well, you heard what the man said," adds Judy.  "I'm going to the bathroom.  Wanna come, Queenie?"  "No, thanks," says the new girl.  "Suit yourself," Judy replies, looking a little surprised. "Don't leave without me, OK?"  Judy leaves to the west.  Queenie notices the book that's protruding from your pocket and asks, "What are you reading?"  What would you like to say?  [1] Tell Queenie about the book you're carrying.

look at mural
This colorful mural, created by a former student, shows a scene that is based, somewhat loosely, on the famous film "The Lion King."  A noble lion, the deceased King Mufasa, looks down from the night sky on two other lions.  A single word is superimposed on the scene   "Remember."

The Enterprise Closet This rather dark, slightly smelly closet is home to the Enterprise Store, a service of the Enterprise Program, an educational project in which about a dozen underachieving eighth graders run their own business.  The closet is packed with piles of soft drinks for the school vending machines and sports a tall set of shelves, mostly  for school supplies that are sold at the store during lunch periods.  Today, one shelf has been reserved for candy grams and other materials for  the day's deliveries.  On the wall, you see the inevitable "Star Trek" plaque, reading "Beam me up, Scotty.  There's no intelligent life here."  Mr. Alltext, however, has crossed out the word "no."  The exit is to the south. Judy whispers in your ear, "I think she likes you," apparently referring to Queenie.  Judy picks up her paperwork for today from a shelf in the closet. Then she takes a look into the manila envelope that contains the candy grams.  "Oh, awesome!" she enthuses.  "I've got a candy gram from my new boyfriend Biff!  We're going to the dance tonight, you know."  "Biff?" You don't know of anyone at your school who's called "Biff," and you can't imagine how anyone from outside the school could have bought a candy gram.  Judy returns the envelope to the shelf, acknowledging that it's your job to actually give out the pops, though she keeps the one from Biff, and makes a note of the delivery.  On the shelf are a list and an envelope (in which are ten candygrams).  You can see Judy, Queenie and some soft drinks here.

e
Room 7 This is the classroom usually occupied by Mr. Pisces, a colorful young science teacher, known for sending the daily attendance to the office via singing student couriers.  Unfortunately, he is also well known for his imminent visit to the hospital for a bone marrow transplant.  The room itself is quite colorful, replete with student projects, including mobiles on a variety of biological topics.  The exit is to the west. As you enter Mr. Pisces' classroom, one of his students, Meghan Mascaras, the "rock star" of the seventh grade, is reading aloud from a biology textbook, a common enough activity, though, somehow, it looks oddly constrained at the moment.   Still, Meghan does the best she can under the circumstances.  "The giant squid is a shy and soli...solitary animal, seldom, if ever, seen by humans," she reads.  "Never...the...less, giant squid carca...carca...carcasses that have washed up on beaches in many parts of the world have given rise to legends of sea monsters like the k..k..kraken. Since the squid has eight long legs, and two more members that are even longer, people sometimes imagine the creature dragging men into the ocean depths with its huge testicles."  The class erupts in laughter, except for Meghan, whose embarrassed chuckle convinces you that her little mistake was an honest one.  Mr. Pisces smiles. Under the circumstances, he does not sweat the small stuff.  "Would you care to make a delivery?" he asks.   You can see Judy, Queenie, Meghan Mascaras and Mr. Pisces here.

e
Room 2 This is a social studies classroom, usually inhabited by the large and lively Mr. McDell.  The room is relatively unadorned, but it does have a mural showing an American Revolution battle scene on the back wall and a large box full of costumes that students sometimes use in skits they develop.  The exit is to the west. Mr. McDell is lecturing, in his usual gently vivid way, to a top level social studies class.  As is customary in such "honors" groups, the kids are taking notes like mad, writing down everything he says.  They barely seem aware of your presence, but, no matter how hard you scan their faces, you can't find Alicia Aronstein, to whom you are supposed to deliver a candy gram.  Mr. McDell winks at you and continues to tell his class about the Crusades.  "The Crusades were a violent and awful mess," he says, "but sometimes there was a high level of blood witted military organization.  For example, in the Sixth Crusade, starting in 1228 C.E., Frederick II, Thibaud de Champagne, and Richard of Cornwall carefully coordinated their plans for travel to the Middle East.  Frederick went by land, Thibaud went by sea, and Richard went by air."  Most of the class continues to write frantically, as Mr. McDell struggles not to laugh out loud.  Queenie cracks a rare smile, too  quite a lovely smile, in fact.  "And now, our enterprising visitors will deliver a candy gram or two," Mr. McDell adds.  "Well," you say, "we were supposed to deliver a candy gram to Alicia Aronstein, but she's not here. Sorry we interrupted your class.  Do you happen to know where she is?"  "Oh, don't worry about coming in for a minute.  We probably needed the break. Alicia used to be in this class, but she switched out some time ago.  Class, does anyone know where Alicia is this period?"  You've seen teachers ask this sort of question many times before, and you're not surprised at the outcome. At least half of the eighteen kids in the class are anxious to reveal where the student in question is, but all of them seem to "know" that she's in different places.  "I'm afraid you'll have to check at the office," says Mr. McDell.  "Thanks for coming by, anyway."  You can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. McDell, a mural and a costume box (in which are some costumes) here.

North South Hall  South End This is the south end of rather long north south hallway.  Ms. Garrulous' classroom is to the west.  To the south are separate boys' and girls' restrooms, but you don't need to enter those spaces right now.  Near Ms. Garrulous' classroom, Room 4, affixed to a bulletin board, you see a small, festively decorated basket for cards and gifts that students and teachers would like to send to Mr. Pisces, one of the school's science teachers, during his upcoming hospital stay.  The door to Room 4, to the west, is closed, but it sports a small window.  Suddenly, three tiny girls, probably eleven year old sixth graders, you would guess, bounce out of a rest room to the south, chatting fervently. One's moving a little faster than the others and gets ahead of her friends, and so she spins around to face them, as she continues to walk along the hall, backwards.  Since she can't see where she's going, the backwards walker veers across the hall unpredictably, bumping into all three of you.  Judy and Queenie take the little collision as a matter of course, but the sixth graders react with silent terror.  Two scramble away to the north, but one, the girl who bumped into you, freezes.  "Well, Stephanie, it looks like you're in big trouble now," says Judy, with an inflection that you, but not the sixth grader, recognize as jocose. You flash back, for a moment, to your own sixth grade experience, when you and your friends would discuss, quite seriously, whether it was possible for a big kid to literally stuff a little kid into a locker.  You can see a basket (which is empty), Judy, Queenie and Stephanie here.

look at Stephanie
Stephanie is a fairly typical sixth grade girl, eleven or so years old, four feet or so in height, weighing no more than seventy five pounds. Recovering some of her composure, Stephanie escapes quietly to the north. You imagine that you're feeling almost as relieved as she is at her exit.   You check your supply of candy grams, noting that all the pops have survived.

Room 4 This is the well stocked math classroom of Ms. Garrulous.  It has lots of colorful posters, a small refrigerator, and pictures of family members  all the comforts of home.  The exit is to east. You enter the classroom of Ms. Garrulous, knowing that there's no math class here right now.  Instead, it's time for Ms. G.'s famous "Girl Talk" mini course.  Still, you're a little surprised to see that the room has been set up as a one chair hair salon.  A girl whom you recognize as Alexis, a seventh grader, is sitting in a chair at the back of the room while the teacher trims some of her green, spiked hair, leaving her with a much more conservative look.  Danielle DeJonses is offering generous helpings of coaching to both barber and barbee.   And, as usual, people are listening.  "Now, you see, Ms. G., what you're really doing here is not just cutting hair.  No, you're not. You're taking Alex back to Alex.  You're making the girl what she is, and that's a GOOD thing."  "Now, we all know that what Alex is an individual.  She's her own girl, and some day soon she'll be her own woman, and that's why she got her green spiky hair, to show she's not just like everybody else.  But her mistake was that the girl  this girl right here  she is isn't a punk, just like she's not a skinhead or a greaser.  Maybe she doesn't even know exactly what she is."  "Well put, Danielle," says Ms. G.  "But why would a fine looking young lady like Alexis get green hair in the first place?"  Alexis starts to answer, but, seeing that Danielle is still on a roll, she decides to defer to her.  "I'm glad you asked me that," says Danielle. "Of course, I don't exactly know, but probably Alexis was hurting a little and figured she'd be somebody else for a while and see if the somebody else wasn't hurting so much.  She's back on the right track now, though.  Nobody knows where she'll end up, but she's on the right track."  You marvel at Danielle's effect on her listeners.  She really sounds like she means what she says.   As Ms. Garrulous finishes her hair cutting, she suggests that you make your candy gram delivery.  You can see Judy, Queenie, Alexis, Danielle DeJonses, Ms. Garrulous and a cake here.
give gram to Danielle
(first taking the candygram) Danielle thanks you, and passes the candy pop along to Alexis.  "Sweet reward for a sweet decision," she explains.  "Well, Ms. G.", Danielle continues, "this mini course is pretty good, today. Lots more memorable than anything we learn in math class  that's for sure!"  "Oh, I don't know about that," says Ms. Garrulous, rising to the challenge. "I think that some of us may remember a math lesson or two."  "Take Doug, here, for example. I'll bet that, with his work in the Enterprise business, he can use some math that he's not studying at the moment."  After glancing around the classroom for a half minute, Ms. Garrulous finds a suitable challenge.  "Please take a look at the cake that we have here, Doug.  As you can see there's a piece missing.  What number appeared on that piece?"  (To answer, type "Say (numerical answer) to Garrulous." In other words, if your answer is " 50," type "Say  50 to Garrulous.")

To the northwest, you can see a corridor that runs past the administrators' offices and eventually to the elementary school part of the building. The door to Room 8, to the west, is closed.  Principal Drenaline approaches you, and, alert, as always, notices that a verboten activity, gum chewing in this case, is going on in his building.  "Judy, get rid of the gum, please," he says firmly.  Judy makes a great show of swallowing her chewing gum, complete with a very convincing gulping sound, but Mr. D. isn't buying it.  "Put the gum into this piece of paper and give it to me," he orders, firmly but fairly, and Judy complies.  "Don't forget to check for hall passes, Doug," says the principal as he heads toward the Cafe for his next encounter, whatever that might be.  "Thanks for helping out."  Having been the object of Mr. Drenaline's gum extraction ritual many times, Judy muses, "I wonder what he does with all those little balls of goo."  "DNA registry?" Queenie speculates.  As suddenly as he left, Principal Drenaline reappears from the south.  "Shouldn't you be wearing that hall monitor's badge, Doug?" he asks before darting off again.

Room 8 This is the science classroom usually occupied by Ms. Empirious, a young science teacher whose strictness and inflexibility are the stuff of middle school legend.  A note scrawled lightly in pencil beside the door reads, "Abandon hope, all you who enter here."  Actually, the note has been written so lightly that you probably wouldn't notice it, if you hadn't put it there.  The exit is to the east. As you pass through the Room 8 doorway, Judy flashes a shy wave toward weird little Ed Dibbles, a student in Ms. Empirious' class.  "Hi, Biff," she whispers toward Ed, adoringly.    Your heart sinks a bit  but your disappointment is exceeded by your incredulity.   Ms. Empirious is presenting a chemistry demonstration near the front of the classroom, not far from the door you've just entered.  She's standing behind a rather elaborate table, with a twenty gallon aquarium on top and a set of shelves that she can see and use, though the front of the desk hides them from the class.  "Now, class," she says in her formal, slightly sing songish voice, "please remember that, like all of our demonstrations, this look at the volatile properties of the element sodium is perfectly, perfectly safe."  She removes a large jar, with a viscous green substance in it, from one of the shelves and places it on the desk, for all to see.  "In this jar," she announces dramatically, "we have a few ounces of the very active metal called sodium.  To keep it from reacting with the surrounding atmosphere, we keep it in the jar, surrounded by an oily gel."  Using a large pair of tweezers manipulated carefully in her left hand, Ms. Empirious lifts a green coated cube, about an inch on each side to the top of the jar.  Next, with a small, sharp looking scissor like device held in her right hand, she snips off a tiny piece of the cube. Then she carefully lowers the cube back into the jar and moves the jar back to the shelf in front of her.   "Now, class, when I drop this tiny piece of sodium into the aquarium, you'll observe a rather violent reaction."  Ms. E. drops the tiny piece of green covered stuff into the aquarium, and, sure enough, it starts smoking and zooming around the surface of the water, finally disappearing with a dramatically loud pop.  The class apparently loves the show and bursts into restrained, but nearly unanimous, applause. Reacting to this rare adulation from students, Ms. Empirious picks up a jar containing a greenish cube once again to show it off to the class; but, most atypically, she moves too quickly and rather clumsily.  She juggles the jar momentarily and then drops it, right into the aquarium.  Ms. E. blesses herself rapidly and looks toward the sky, as the class goes silent with terror.  You can see Judy, Queenie, Ms. Empirious, Ed Dibbles and an aquarium (in which is a jar) here.  [Your score has just gone up by one point.]
take jar
After pausing for a second or two to evaluate the situation, noting that you're not dead yet, you reach into the aquarium with your free hand and pluck out the jar, which, you notice, does not actually seem to be smoking or sputtering at all.  Ms. E. then bursts into laughter, as the class becomes ready to kill her.  "Well done, Doug," she chuckles.  "You wouldn't have saved us if that had been a real jar of sodium, but it was a brave thing to do anyway."  "Now, class," says the teacher, "I told you this was perfectly safe, didn't I?  Now that you look closely, as I always urge you to do, you can see that the jar Doug pulled from the water is similar to, but certainly not the same as, the one I used earlier.  And all's well that ends well."  "Now, Enterprisers, you may endeavor to deliver a candy gram or two."  You hand the ersatz sodium jar to Ms. Empirious.
give gram to ed
(first taking the candygram) Ed thanks you and winks at Judy.  As you finish making your delivery, you notice that Ms. Empirious is moving the original sodium jar from its shelf under the demonstration table, presumably to a more permanent storage area.  You look twice to see whether this is the actual sodium jar, but it certainly appears to be the real thing this time.  Incredibly, though, as she lifts the jar, Ms. E. seems to experience a brief fainting spell and drops the jar squarely into the aquarium. She blesses herself three times, very rapidly, and stares wide eyed into the tank.  The class gasps loudly, hoping the End will be quick.  You decide you might as well repeat your previous heroics; but you're half way across the room from the aquarium after your visit with Ed, nowhere near as close to the demonstration as you were before.   It takes you a full second or more to get to the front of the room, and, by that time, you've noticed that, once again, there's absolutely no sign of any smoking or bubbling in the water.  This time, Queenie starts chuckling first, followed closely by Judy and Ms. E.  "Yes, class, once again you can see that our demonstration was perfectly safe," the teacher coos. "The material you saw buzzing around and popping in the water at the start of the class was not pure sodium, which would be too risky for us to keep around here.  It was actually a mechanical device designed to simulate sodium for chemistry demonstrations like this one."  "So now you've learned, and will never forget, the highly reactive qualities of sodium. And you've also learned to look twice."  Mrs. Empirious now turns to you.  "Thank you, Enterprisers for your kind and highly alert visit."  [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

She is not wearing a visitor's badge.  Your heart sinks a bit when you realize that this person definitely does not work at Neil Armstrong, though she does look a bit familiar.  You know that you're supposed to send her to go the office for an ID label.  You can see Judy, Queenie and a tall woman here.

At first, the woman seems surprised at this challenge, but, noting your hall monitor's badge, she quickly regains her composure and assumes a condescendingly pleasant manner that you find acutely painful.  "Oh, no, young man, I don't need a visitor's badge. You see, I'm Dr. McKie, the superintendent of schools."  That's why she was familiar, all right.  You can feel your face reddening, as Judy chuckles quietly.  "I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you, Dr. McBeak," you reply smoothly.  Judy laughs out loud at this one, despite an attempt not to.  After a second's hesitation, Dr. McKie laughs, too.  Now you're ready to sink directly into the floor.  Mercifully, Dr. McKie chooses not to prolong the conversation.  "Good luck with your deliveries, Enterprise employees," the superintendent coos, as she disappears in the direction of the Cafe.  "Wandering monster," quips Queenie.  "Could have happened to anyone."

Room 10 Room 10 is a small, colorful classroom that seems to be home to four students, at the moment, along with their teacher and a student volunteer, Alicia, whom you've been seeking.  You know that, sometimes, there are two or three other kids here, along with a couple of aides, but, right now, the others are probably attending regular classes in which they are "mainstreamed."  The exit is to the north. Ms. Fuerstein's class is conducting a poetry reading for Valentine's Day.  The kids and their teacher have recorded brief poetic selections on hearts cut from construction paper and are reading them without hesitation, suggesting that they've been practicing.  A rather round little girl, whom you recognize as Andrea, reads, very dramatically, "This is by Victor Hugo, a famous French writer. 'What a grand thing, to be loved! What a grander thing still, to love!'"  Ms. Fuerstein reads, rather calmly, "'I came to love, I came into my own.'  That was by Theodore Roethke, an American poet."  Joanie, a tall, rather pretty girl with a slight facial tic reads, "'I love you  I am at rest with you  I have come home.' By Dorothy Sayers, an English writer of mysteries."  And Alicia Aronstein reads, very pointedly directing her words passionately to the class in which she has volunteered, "The Turkish poet Mihri Hatun said, 'At one glance, I love you with a thousand hearts.'"   There is a long, comfortable pause, and then you find that you have to applaud.  Ms. Fuerstein applauds, too, and invites you to deliver whatever you've brought.

Room 11 This is the classroom of Ms. Picasso, a teacher of Grade Six English. The room has an open, modern look, and the students are assembled in a U shaped configuration, facing a whiteboard, on which appears most of a poem entitled "Prejudice."  The exit is to the south. "Your task, class," says Ms. Picasso, in her firm but artsy way, "has been to do some creative problem solving.  You've read the poem that's on the board very carefully, and you've noted that the poem is incomplete, that it's missing its last line and a half."  "You've been trying to figure out how the poem ends, and you've come close. You've thought about the ideas in the poem, including its title. And you've considered the sounds of the verse, about which I've given you this hint: the rhyme scheme of the last stanza is 'abcb.'"  "You've done some good thinking on this puzzle, but, you seem to be stuck."  "Now, as you can see, it happens that some of our eighth grade students have joined us.

Room 6 is a large, sunny room, crowded with student desk chair combinations, and, of all things, computers, which kids use for word processing and for reading computer based literature.  The room has lots of teacher made posters about literature and the writing process, and a single, long, commercially printed poster called "A History of Interactive Fiction." Among the student creations displayed here is a verse riddle.  The exit is to the east. As you enter Mr. Alltext's class, you notice that, since you last saw him, he's put on an eye patch, which he's wearing under his usual glasses. Mr. A.'s English class is reading the interactive novel Zork aloud, and, in the story, the player character is just entering the lair of a one eyed monster called a Cyclops.  "Now, class," he says, "this giant Cyclops looks pretty formidable, but you can scare him away by mentioning the name of his great tormentor in a famous classical epic.  Who is the conqueror of the Cyclops?"  No one in the class answers.  "Doug?" he asks.  You really do know the answer but you can't quite call it to mind right now.  From the doorway, Queenie, who seems to be hanging back a little, whispers, "Odysseus," and you immediately know she's right.  What would you like to say?  [1] "Queenie's got it." [2] "I remember now.  It's 'Odysseus.'"  Select an option or 0 to say nothin

Mr. Alltext turns to Queenie.  "Odysseus," she answers.  Suddenly, Mr. Alltext growls, and appears to run, quite hard, into the front wall of the classroom, creating a loud "bang" by smacking his palms against the drywall.  He does a pretty good pratfall, too.  Queenie, going along with the gag, withdraws a step or two in mock amazement.  After righting himself, Mr. Alltext types, "Say Odysseus," into the computer, and the class reads the result, a panicked rush by the creature, right through a nearby wall.  Looking a bit rumpled after his thespian exploits, Mr. A. invites you to make your deliveries, if any.  Queenie smiles in your direction, perhaps in thanks for your directing the 'Odysseus' question to her.  You can see Judy, Queenie, Mr. Alltext, Jim Hastely and a verse riddle here.
give gram to jim
(first taking the candygram)  Jim accepts the candy gram and thanks you for delivering it.  Very quietly, he says to Queenie, "You know, I could have given that answer, but I decided I didn't want to look like the only one who know it.  Next time, I think I'll do what you did."  "Maybe you'd like to try my verse riddle. The idea is to figure out the title." (To answer the riddle, type "Say 'your answer' to Jim." In other words, if you think the poem's title is "flame," type "Say flame to Jim."  [Your score has just gone up by one point.]

"Well, Doug, how have the deliveries gone?" asks Mr. Alltext.  You convey the relevant information to Mr. Alltext, and Judy provides her records of your work.  "Hmm.  It looks as though you've delivered all six of the cards you were assigned.  That's a really fine job."  "You've bought one addition gram, and for a very good reason, too.  Well done, though you might be able to do even better.""Now that you've finished the deliveries," says Mr. Alltext, "I'd like Judy to do a final check of the records she kept. Meanwhile, Doug, I think you and Queenie should return the envelope and list to the Enterprise Closet."    "And don't forget the big dance tonight."  Mr. Alltext returns the candy gram envelope to you.

You're more than a little nervous about this question, about which you've been thinking for some time now, but you're glad, at least to start with, that you asked simply and direcly.  "Queenie," she replies.  "You know, I'm still not really used to that nickname.  I just started using it a couple weeks ago."  She pauses, almost as if she's forgotten your question, but you can tell that, really, she's just thinking before she answers.  When she does speak, there's an unusual lilt to her voice, as if she's remembering something.   "I can't go tonight.  I'm babysitting."  And your heart sinks.  "So it'll have to be tomorrow night. I'm sure we can think of something good to do."  "But, no, on second thought, I'll get someone else to babysit. Let's just meet in the cafe at 7:30."  Queenie shows that bright little smile again, and you're not sure you've ever been this high before.  On second thought, with your feet barely touching the ground, you're sure that this is wonderfully, brand new. [Your score has just gone up by two points.]

The Cafe The Neil Armstrong Middle and Elementary School Cafeteria is a big, unadorned room that echoes like Carlsbad Caverns whenever there's any noise at all, though it's quiet here now.  There's an exit to the west; and a door to the north leads to the Enterprise closet, where materials for your special task of the day are stored.  You can see Queenie and a pastoral mural here.
open door
You use the key to open the closet door, noting that, as usual, the door remains locked, so that closing it will prevent entry by anyone without a key.

Life sucks. Today has been just another crummy day in another dismal spring which you've spent delivering pizzas. This afternoon has totally been dragging, except for that bit of excitement an hour ago when you broke the soda machine. You thought your boss was going to rip you a new orifice.  Anyway, you've just finished mopping up behind the counter. There's only one more hour left on your shift and you're anxious to get out of here. Go home, watch the tube, blast some tunes, maybe scan the new "Surfers Monthly" magazine... gonna be a nice relaxing evening.  Shyeah, right. That's what YOU think.

Updated and revised 1998 Release 1 / Serial number 990110 / Inform v6.10 Library 6/5 Standard interpreter 1.0  Behind the Counter You are behind the counter at "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor", where you are currently working. Not much of a job, but it keeps you from going broke during the nine months of the year when you can't pull down the bucks as surfing instructor. The rest of the parlor is southwest.  There is something pressing that you think you have to do, but you can't think what it might be.

It's a majorly boring counter which you're unfortunately very familiar with.  Hey, maybe that handwritten note lying next to a pizza box on the counter is related to whatever it is you're supposed to be doing now.

The note reads:  "Stanley,     Don't forget to make your delivery to Mr. Calzone, located at the San Doppleton Courthouse. You're already on thin ice, kid. One more screwup and you can expect to be looking for a new job."  The note is signed with the initials "RT". The paper is official "Mr. Tasty's" stationery with the name Bob "Tasty" Tasker and lots of balloons and smiley faces all over the border. Isn't that cute?

You walk around to the front of the pizza parlor.  Pizza Parlor You are standing in the middle of "Mr. Tasty's Pizza Parlor". The counter separating you from the back of the parlor stretches in front of you on the northeast corner of the room. To the south is an exit to the street.  On the counter is a handwritten note.

Street, by Pizza Parlor San Doppleton is where you live, work and play    at least until summer. It has the typical California culture; which is to say, none. But at least it's just forty minutes' drive from Santa Barbara and the beach, so you can't complain much.  You stand in the heart of San Doppleton's main drag, the business district. The street goes east and west. The sidewalk runs by a pizza parlor, with a sewer vent nearby.  Two men bump into each other. They murmur apologies and go their separate ways.
w
Street, Near Courthouse You are approaching the center of downtown San Doppleton. There is a courthouse to the south. The street runs east and west.
s
Courthouse You are in a crowded courthouse.  The street is off to the north.  The courtroom is currently abuzz with excitement as it seems that the pre trial hearing of the infamous gangster, Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone is winding to a close. Guido and his hotshot lawyer sit placidly at their table, while the flustered young district attorney who is prosecuting the case seems like she's at her wits' end. At the moment, the D.A. stands at the front of the courtroom, arguing over a legal point with the judge.
x district attorney
You've never been up to date on local politics, but you can see that the DA is an attractive brunette in her mid thirties. Why, that would make her only, uh... ten years old than you!  The more you look at her, the more you think she's a total babe! You bet she could totally go for a guy like you!  After all, she's a brilliant, successful career oriented woman with a promising future ahead of her, and you're... you're a college dropout pizza delivery boy.  Never mind.  "Miss Thompson," says the judge, "I've had about enough of you wasting this court's time. Unless you can demonstrate a clear threat to public safety, I'm going to recommend that Mr. Calzone be transported to a minimum security prison pending further review. His trial is to be held next week."  Jill is clearly not happy with this pronouncement.
z
Time passes.  "Your honor, I wish you would reconsider," says Jill. "The defendant has a long history of disappearances, and it is counsel's opinion that he will not be around in a week to stand trial. I recommend transporting him to a more secure prison."
open pizza box
You flip open the pizza box, revealing a large pizza.  "Your opinion is duly noted, Miss Thompson," says the judge sarcastically. "But the fact is, the 'long history' you refer to is based on hearsay. Now, I recommend you gather some solid evidence when you prepare for the trial, because the minimal research you've obviously done won't be enough to convict the defendant."
search pizza
Digging through layers of cheese, you discover and confiscate a metal file.  Jill tries desperately to convince the judge that Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone plans to escape, but it's obvious she won't get anywhere without more evidence.  [Your score has just gone up by two points.]
show file to district attorney
Jill looks astonished when you tell her where you found the file. She marches smartly up to the stand and shows this new evidence to the judge, who can't argue with her logic. He orders Guido into a maximum security prison pending further review.  As the courtroom clears out, the bailiff drags Guido past you. With intense calm, Guido looks you right in the eye and says, "That was a mistake, my friend. It don't pay to mess with The Family.  "I believe THIS belongs to me," he adds, ungraciously snatching the pizza box from your hands on the way out.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

Jill is here.  Jill approaches and shakes your hand warmly. "That was a brilliant work in there, kid. If it hadn't been for you, Guido might have escaped from jail."  Seeing your blank look, she says, "My name Jill Thompson. I'm San Doppleton's District Attorney. For the past four years, I've been pursuing this local mafia branch, trying to bring some serious legal action down on them. These guys seem to own everything in town, and they already know me by sight. So I can't find any more clues before the trial but you can. Please try dig up whatever information you can, I'll be up in my office if you need me. I work at Gunther & Associates. It's on the third floor of that tall building over there, you can't miss it."  Jill walks away to the west.  Street, Near Courthouse

Downtown You are in downtown San Doppleton. The street coming from the east ends at a three story office building to the west.  A guy in a business suit walks past you.

n
The stairs angle up and back, and you emerge south.  Office Building, Second Floor To the east you can see an office door labelled "Gunther & Associates"; other than that, the office doors on this floor are pretty unremarkable. The stairs go up to the south and down to the north.
e
Law Office You are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.  Jill stands here.  As you walk into the office, Jill spots you. "Hi!" she says. "Listen, Stan. I have reason to believe that the Mayor is tangled up in the mafia. I managed to use some connections to get this key. It unlocks the mayor's cabinet."  She hands you a key. "I'd use it myself, but I already have several eyes on me at all times. They know me."

You smugly retrieve the file.  Just are you're starting to feel disappointed about how easy it was to search around in the mayor's secret files, you hear a commotion out in the hall. Suddenly, you find yourself staring into the shifty face of Mayor Winnick himself. He quickly assesses the situation and makes a curt gesture. In walks a very large, very ugly lackey, who begins to approach with a nasty look in his eye.  The henchman approaches with a mean gleam in his eye.

Hangin' Out You are dangling over a three story drop, desperately clutching the window ledge with your fingertips. And as if that weren't bad enough, a very angry mayor and a very large security guard are inside, and they're both very eager to get rid of you.  Your feet are just low enough to touch the window on the next floor below you.  Inside the window, you hear the mayor and the lackey congratulating each other on getting rid of you.

You've never been so happy to see anyone in your life.  Law Office You are in a bustling law office. The east wall is dominated by a large window.  Jill stands here.  You briefly relate to Jill what's just been happening to you. Jill looks thoughtful as she takes the file from you. "So you uncovered evidence that the mayor is connected to the mob?  And he knows that you found out. This sounds serious. If I'm not mistaken, every cop in the district is going to be after your head pretty soon.  "Good work, though, Stan. Don't stop now.

As you enter the cosmetics department, a big thug steps out of the shadows. Making a mocking bow in your direction, the thug says: "Greetings. I am Sammy 'The Inhospitable' Toriglioni, and I will be joining you for your dying pleasure this afternoon."  He pulls a gun out of his suit coat and bounces it lightly in one hand.  Cosmetics Department The shelves are lined with bottles of perfume, cologne, hairspray, and other cosmetic paraphernalia.

You press yourself against a wall until it goes by.  The ground trembles under your feet. It feels like an earthquake might be in progress.  Okay, let's recap the story so far. Your afternoon got off to an interesting start when you foiled an escape attempt by Guido "The Armadillo" Calzone. This heroic but not terribly bright action brought down the wrath of the local mafia down on you, who tried to assassinate you inside a department store. They also left a "special delivery" for you which started an earthquake. You were also responsible for uncovering the illicit activities of the corrupt mayor, who then sent every cop and trooper in the area to take care of you. So, you're hounded by the police, wanted dead by the mob, and trying to cope with a massive earthquake.  As you step outside, you can see that the people of the town have succumbed to the general chaos of the environment, and now the town of San Doppleton is marred by heavy rioting.

You skim through the pages of the journal, a combination diary and notebook. Most of the notations, written in Belboz's familiar flowing script, deal with meetings of the Circle and business of the Guild.  There is one interesting entry toward the end of the book. Belboz refers to an ancient and evil force known simply as Jeearr, a demon whose powers could endanger the Circle and possibly the entire kingdom. He has decided to conduct some dangerous exploratory experiments, operating alone to shield the Circle from the perils involved.  The last three entries are strange and frightening    written in a hand quite different from that of Belboz, and in a language totally unfamiliar to you.  On the inside cover is an inscription, written in a light script, which reads "Current code: bloodworm".  "Squawk! Where did I leave my spectacles? Squawk!"

Lobby This is the entrance lobby of the Guild Hall. Befitting the status and wealth of the Guild, the lobby is finished with polished Antharian marble, inlaid with intricate patterns of silver leaf. To the north is a wide arch, and smaller openings flank the area on the eastern and western sides, as well as the northeastern and northwestern corners. A narrow stair leads downward. Through another arch to the south, you can see the entrance steps and the main road into town. Affixed to the southern arch is an ornate brass receptacle, intended for use by messengers.

AIMFIZ BELBOZ
As you cast the spell, the moldy scroll vanishes!  After a momentary dizziness, you realize that your location has changed, although Belboz is not in sight...  Twisted Forest You are on a path through a blighted forest. The trees are sickly, and there is no undergrowth at all. One tree here looks climbable. The path, which ends here, continues to the northeast.  A hellhound is racing straight toward you, its open jaws displaying rows of razor sharp teeth.
NE
Forest Edge To the west, a path enters the blighted woods, which stretch out of sight. A signpost stands beside another path leading north, and to the east is a wide meadow. At the base of the signpost is a slimy hole leading down. The hellhound stops at the edge of the forest and bellows. After a moment, it turns and slinks into the trees.
E
Meadow You are in the center of a barren field. To the east is the turret of a ruined castle, and from the northeast comes the sound of rushing water.  A swarm of bloodsucking locusts appears on the horizon.
NE
River Bank You are on a muddy bank of a fast moving river, full of sharp rocks and foaming rapids, flowing to the southwest. The ground is soft and eroded, and continually threatens to dump you into the turbulent waters. A field lies to the southwest, and a trail leads southeast along the bank.
LEARN PULVER

NE
Hidden Cave This is a hollow area under the northeast bank of the river. The floor rises away from the mouth of the cave, which is at its southwest end. A dark hole leads downward at the far end of the cave. Lying in the corner, in a pile of bat guano, is a scroll. There is an amber vial here.

As you cast the spell, the ordinary scroll vanishes!  The words of the spell glow brightly for a moment.
LEARN MALYON
Using your best study habits, you learn the malyon spell.
MALYON DRAGON
The dragon is suddenly imbued with life and begins to move. It shakes itself loose from the wall, which crumbles down upon the dragon, revealing a southward passage! The dragon howls with pain and anger. Spotting you, the dragon rears back its head, smoke billowing from its nostrils. Then, just as it seems that you will be barbecued, the dragon reverts to stone!
S
Sooty Room The walls and ceiling of this room are covered with soot and held up by timbers which don't look very sturdy. A winding tunnel leads north. From the east comes a sulfurous odor.
OPEN ORANGE VIAL
Opening the orange vial reveals orange potion.
FROTZ ME
You are bathed in a sickly yellow light, bright enough to read by.  Your muscles feel limp for a moment.
E
There is a rumbling noise behind you as the ceiling of the tunnel collapses, blocking your retreat! The air smells strongly of coal gas. You won't survive long in this atmosphere.  Coal Bin Room This is obviously the heart of a large coal mine, illuminated by a wall mounted lamp. The bottom of a metal coal chute is visible at the north end of the room. Another chute continues downward at the southern end. A large coal bin is overflowing, and the floor is completely covered with lumps of coal. A passage leads east, but a western passage is blocked by rubble.
DRINK POTION
The orange potion tasted like pepper, and made your nose tingle.  A few lumps of coal spill from the coal chute.  Someone slides out of the coal chute, and lands near the bin. Although your clothes are much cleaner and less torn, the stranger looks virtually like your own twin!
THROW ALL BUT BOOK INTO LOWER CHUTE
magic amulet: The magic amulet disappears into the chute. indigo vial: The indigo vial disappears into the chute. amber vial: The amber vial disappears into the chute. orange vial: The orange vial disappears into the chute.  Your disheveled "twin" is having difficulty breathing, but gasps, "The combination is 639." Your older self then looks at you, almost expectantly.
GIVE BOOK TO TWIN
Your older self accepts the spell book gratefully.  Your look alike dives into the lower chute and slides out of view.
E
Dial Room On the eastern wall is a heavy door with a dial set into it. There is a sign on the door. Another exit leads west, and a wall mounted lamp provides illumination. The floor is deeply covered with lumps of coal.
TURN DIAL TO 639
The dial is now set to 639. You hear a click from inside the door.

W
Top of Chute You are at the western end of the coal mine. A metal chute leads downward.

The rope is tied securely to the center of the beam.  A troglodyte trundles in and dumps a load of coal into the chute.
PUT TIMBER ACROSS CHUTE
The beam is now lying across the mouth of the chute.  The troglodyte trundles off into the coal mine.
THROW ROPE INTO CHUTE
The rope hangs from the beam, into the chute.  A troglodyte trundles in and dumps a load of coal into the chute.
D
You climb carefully down the rope, which is slippery with coal dust, and soon reach a small opening off the chute. You clamber inside...  Slanted Room This small room has a slanted roof, presumably due to the coal chute which passes overhead. You can reenter the chute to the east. There is a shimmering scroll here. Mounted securely to the wall is a kerosene lamp, filling the room with a serene orange glow. A small compartment at its base is open.
GET SHIMMERING SCROLL
Taken.
READ IT
The scroll reads "golmac spell: travel temporally".  You feel the vilstu potion beginning to wear off, and the air here seems pretty unbreathable.
GOLMAC ME
As you cast the spell, the shimmering scroll vanishes!  You are surrounded by a puff of smoke, and feel disoriented for a moment. When the smoke clears, nothing seems to have changed, except that the kerosene lamp is now closed.
OPEN LAMP
Opening the kerosene lamp reveals a smelly scroll.
GET SMELLY SCROLL

D
Wheeee!!!  Coal Bin Room Standing here, looking quite confused, is someone who could only be your younger self    an exact duplicate of you, but cleaner and breathing with considerably less difficulty. You remember seeing this scene from another viewpoint just a short while ago. Among the items carried by your "twin" is your spell book.  The vilstu potion has almost completely worn off now, and I doubt you could survive here without it.
WAIT
Time passes...  Your younger self is attempting to move an orange vial.
WAIT
Time passes...  Your younger self hands you your spell book!
SAY TO TWIN "THE COMBINATION IS 639"
Your younger self seems surprised by your statement.  A few lumps of coal spill from the coal chute.  Your younger self is moving around.
D
You fly out of the chute and land just at the edge of some water...  Lagoon Shore This is a narrow beach between a small cove to the east and tall cliffs to the west. The shore curves to the southeast and northeast. A metal chute leads up into the cliff.
WAIT
Time passes...  You feel the final effects of the vilstu potion vanish, leaving you totally exhausted (an unfortunate side effect).
SLEEP
Ah, sleep! It's been a long day and rest will do you good. You spread your cloak on the floor and drift off, renewing your powers and refreshing your mind. Time passes as you snore blissfully.  You dream of a river, slow and muddy. Great grey hippopotami sport there, bellowing and splashing, and twitching their ears. You awaken and stand.
LEARN MEEF, MEEF AND SWANZO

Surface of Lagoon You are swimming on the surface of a calm lagoon, whose sandy floor is visible below. A curved beach surrounds this inlet on its western side.
D
Lagoon Floor This is the floor of a cove off the turbulent ocean to the east. The ground slopes upward to the north, west, and south. Light filters down from the surface of the water. An orange vial, labelled in tiny letters, is lying here. There is an amber vial here. There is an indigo vial here. There is an amulet here. The amulet's jewel is pulsing with flashes of brilliant light. Nestled among some coral is a clump of stunningly beautiful spenseweeds, waving slowly in the currents of the lagoon.
MEEF WEEDS
The spenseweeds wilt away, revealing a wooden crate labelled with black lettering.
OPEN CRATE
Opening the wooden crate reveals a can of grue repellent, a brass lantern, and a grue suit.  You won't be able to hold your breath much longer.

Ocean Shore North You are standing on the western shore of the mighty Flathead Ocean. According to legends you read at the University, the eastern shore of this ocean is a strange land of magical beings and priceless treasures. You could go north along the shore; the edge of a small cove lies to the southwest.
N
Mouth of River A mighty river spills into the ocean here. Looking up the river valley, you see a tall waterfall. Atop a cliff, high above you, is the rampart of a fortress. A cave entrance at the base of the cliff to the west is blocked by writhing green vines.
MEEF VINES
You can almost feel a wave of pain from the vines as they shrivel away.
W
Grue Lair This is a low, shadowy cave leading east to west. The rocky walls are scarred with deep claw marks. A pack of grues fills the room! The grues, contrary to all conventional wisdom, aren't bothered by your light in the least. They must be mutated grues, no longer fearing light! They seem to be ignoring you, aside from a few suspicious gurgles in your direction.
W
Mammoth Cavern This cavern is of extraordinary size, but nevertheless crowded with powerful looking machinery. You recognize a breeder for producing millions of the mutated grues you just passed. Other devices seem designed to aid the forces of evil while sapping magic powers of Enchanters everywhere.  At the far end of the cavern are three closed doors: a black marble door leading to the northwest, a shiny silver door heading due west, and a door of bleached white wood to the southwest.
OPEN WHITE DOOR
The door creaks slowly open. Within, you see someone lying as though asleep. You feel yourself drawn into the room...  Belboz's Hideout An acrid stench fills this small room, which is obviously a control center for the evil experiments in the cavern outside. Hanging on the wall is a heavy dagger, its handle encrusted with diamonds. Belboz is lying here, motionless but not asleep. He seems to be in some sort of trance.
VARDIK ME
As you cast the spell, the smelly scroll vanishes!  A feeling of warmth and protection fills your mind.
SWANZO BELBOZ
He hands you a photo of Uncle Buddy and a letter saying, "Her will instructed I give you this photo, with the poem, to point you in the right direction. Also this letter and here, you'll need this." He gives you a flashlight. "Meet me at 9 a.m. in the living room with all the 'treasures' and you'll inherit her entire estate," he says as the limo pulls away and disappears into the night's darkness.

Game Room This was your favorite room as a child. Each summer Uncle Buddy would have props and models from his various movies brought here for the amusement of his numerous guests. There is a scale model of downtown Tokyo here. Doorways lead south, east and west. There is a door to the north.
EXAMINE MODEL
It's the scale model of downtown Tokyo used in the movie "Atomic Chihuahuas From Hell." In the center of the model is Tokyo Central Park. In the eastern half of the park there is a monument. There is a Big Diamond Ring perched on top of the monument. Stretching east and west from the park is Tokyo's main street. In the street west of the park there is an Atomic Chihuahua. The entire model is covered by a thick plastic dome. Outside the dome on the model there are five buttons: a blue button, a black button, a green button, a white button and a red button.  Somewhere in the house you hear the thud of something falling on the floor.
PRESS GREEN
The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves east, then comes to a stop.  Suddenly, several blocks east of the Atomic Chihuahua, a pair of tiny tanks turn a corner onto the main street. They're heading straight for the Atomic Chihuahua. Out of the corner of your eye you notice a puny plane flying over the park. The puny plane banks, turning towards the main street.
PRESS GREEN
The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.  The tanks, only a block away, begin firing as they move within range. Over the park, a second puny plane joins the first one. As the gunfire strikes the Atomic Chihuahua, its heavy reptilian tail pounds the street's pavement angrily.
PRESS GREEN
The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves further east, then comes to a stop.  The Atomic Chihuahua continues to take hits from the tiny tanks. The planes, only a block away, begin firing as they move within range. The Atomic Chihuahua's bulging eyes wince with pain as several rounds fire into its chest.
PRESS BLACK
The Atomic Chihuahua lifts its hind leg and, just as you thought this game was going to become even more base, stomps its clawed foot down on one of the tiny tanks, crushing it.  The Atomic Chihuahua continues to take hits from the tiny tank. The planes, spewing bullet shaped death, reach the radioactive reptile and begin circling around it. The Atomic Chihuahua takes two rounds in the throat and gasps. (Two rounds to you and me, but that's 14 rounds to little scale face!)
PRESS BLACK
The Atomic Chihuahua lifts its hind leg and, just as you thought this game was going to become even more base, stomps its clawed foot down on the other tiny tank, crushing it.  The Atomic Chihuahua continues to take fire from the puny planes. The Atomic Chihuahua's bulging eyes wince with pain as several rounds fire into its chest.
PRESS WHITE
The Atomic Chihuahua swipes at the puny planes, striking one. A puff of black smoke begins to trail from the puny plane. It rolls to one side, then heads down, crashing in a Tokyo suburb.  The Atomic Chihuahua continues to take fire from the puny plane. The Atomic Chihuahua takes two rounds in the throat and gasps. (Two rounds to you and me, but that's 14 rounds to little scale face!)

PRESS GREEN
The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves into the west end of the park, violating all leash laws.  Suddenly out from under a clump of trees at the east end of the park, a tiny truck with a rocket mounted on it rolls into view. (Apparently, violating Tokyo's leash laws is not taken lightly.) A small radar dish on the tiny truck spins furiously until it locks in on the Atomic Chihuahua and stops. A puff of smoke comes from the back of the rocket as it blasts off toward the dog.
PRESS GREEN
The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves to the east end of the park right in front of a monument, near the tiny truck. The rocket follows close behind.  The rocket speeds toward the Atomic Chihuahua and begins circling as it nears.
PRESS BLACK
The Chihuahua raises his hind leg and soundly stomps the tiny truck, smashing it to bits. The rocket heads straight for the Atomic Chihuahua, then begins to swerve and dive erratically. It sails past the Atomic Chihuahua, colliding with Tokyo's tallest building, the Ginsu Building, corporate headquarters of the Ginsu Knife Company. Just as your mind pauses to consider the possibility of a Ginsu knife standing up to this kind of punishment, the rocket explodes and the entire building collapses. Tokyo isn't saved but millions of late night TV viewers are.
PRESS BLUE
The Atomic Chihuahua clutches the Big Diamond Ring in its front claws.
PRESS GREEN
The Atomic Chihuahua, in its best prehistoric prance, moves forward, crushing the monument. Dozens of local pigeons commence mourning. The dog leaves the park and moves into the street.

The film was never released and no one knows what happened to the only full length version, worth a fortune today. Rumor has it that as he was dying he proclaimed "A Corpse Line" to be his masterwork of horror. Other rumors say the film was so bad that, if it had been released and he hadn't died, someone would have killed him. Several rows of plush theatre like seats face a movie screen.

It is not exactly the kind of homey kitchen most people's aunts have. The whole family remembers the Christmas everyone received fruit cakes with serial numbers on them. A doorway leads to the east and stairs lead down from here.  Next to the sink is a matchbox.

EXAMINE COMPUTER
It's the huge, massive, steel contraption of a computer that saved the earth from the maurading marketeers in "Plan Nine from Marketing." The front of the computer is covered with rows of lights. Beneath the lights is a slot and a button. There is a hopper on one end of it. The computer is off.

Garden, South You're standing on a stone walkway in Aunt Hildegarde's much envied garden where she would spend hours tending to her flowers, bushes and trees. The garden was off limits to you as a child because of an incident one summer when you and Cousin Herman were playing in the garden. You suggested pretending to be wild African animals and climbed a tree and began to screech like a baboon while Cousin Herman ran off toward the roses shouting something about being a rhinoceros.  After howling until your throat felt like you had puffed on one of Uncle Buddy's Hollywood cigars, you went to find Cousin Herman. When you arrived you couldn't believe your eyes    Cousin Herman had pulled all the thorns off of all of Aunt Hildegarde's rose bushes in a quest to find the biggest thorn possible so he could be a rhino. Of course when Aunt Hildegarde saw her naked rose bushes, Cousin Herman blamed it all on you. The walkway leads south, northeast and northwest.

Entrance to Hedge Maze This is the entrance to the hedge maze. Aunt Hildegarde told you never to go into the maze without the map, and of course you would go in anyway and she would have to come in and find you.  Guests were forever getting lost in the maze at parties. Sometimes you wished Cousin Herman would go in and never come out. But you always had the feeling he was thinking the same about you, only more seriously. Tall hedges, thick and green, stretch along paths leading to the east and west and a grass path north enters the maze. A stone walkway leads south.

Northeast Junction In this corner of the backyard you can make out the enormous hedge, which is part of the estate's hedge maze. The stone walkway splits in three directions here: north, along the dark and towering hedge; south, past the fragrant and inviting garden; and west, where the walkway cuts a straight and narrow path between the hedge and the garden. A slightly worn path in the grass heads east.

You follow the walkway as it turns west around the hedge leading to...  Cannon Emplacement This is a cannon emplacement complete with a Civil War style cannon and a neatly stacked pyramid of cannon balls. During the day this area affords a spectacular view of the coastline. Stone walkways lead east and west, and a steep path leads down.  From the ocean there is the distant ringing of warning buoys.

Top Landing This is a rickety landing at the top of a long flight of old, wooden stairs leading down to the beach far below.

You continue down a short flight of stairs then sail onto the sandy beach. You quickly stop with the drag of the sand and a feeble attempt to snow plow.  Beach This is the end of a beach which stretches to the east. The fine white sand underfoot reflects the light. A slight breeze blows off the ocean to the north. A wooden landing is south of here, and an inlet lies west.  Lying near the fire is a green match.  You can see a small, smoldering fire here.

Bomb Shelter This place looks like a bomb shelter. The plain concrete walls and floor remind you of a prison cell. A heavy duty sawhorse has a heavy wooden plank across it. Suspended above the left end of the plank by a rope is a safe. The rope stretches from the safe, through a pulley in the ceiling, to the floor where it is tied to a pipe running along the wall. In the ceiling above the right end of the plank there is a closed hatch. A long chain hangs down from the hatch. Just beneath the hatch there is a pair of heavy duty metal hooks protruding from the wall. There is a doorway leading south.
PULL CHAIN
You pull on the long, greasy chain and the hatch pops up, revealing a hole in the ceiling.
BURN ROPE WITH CANDLE
You touch the flame to the rope then pull it back. The rope catches fire and begins to burn.
ENTER RIGHT END OF PLANK
You are now on the right end of the plank.  The rope continues to burn.
WAIT
Time passes.  As the flame burns through the rope it snaps and the safe crashes down on the left end of the plank. The right end of the plank catapults you up through the opening in the ceiling. The thrilling sensation of flying ends as you land on your feet on a cliff.  Cliff This cliff affords the same spectacular view as from the cannon emplacement above. Far below you and stretching east, you see the white sands of a beach, illuminated by the moon's glow. You can hear the faint sound of waves lapping at the shore. Nearby in the ground is an open hatch, forming a hole which leads down.  There is an unusual ladder lying on the ground here.

PUT PEG IN HOLE
You put the missing peg in the hole and the closet door slams shut. Without warning the floor drops out from under you! You fall for several seconds then land with a bone crunching thud, dropping everything you're holding. You slide down a twisting, slippery slide and are dumped into a room filled with props.  You look around the room and can't believe what your eyes are seeing. There is Aunt Hildegarde! She's tied to a conveyor belt, heading for a buzz saw's whirling blade. She's about a foot away from the blade! A man is standing over her. Aunt Hildegarde sees you and screams for help. The man turns and you immediately recognize your childhood nemesis: Cousin Herman.  Prop Vault This is a vault filled with props. You can see Aunt Hildegarde tied to a buzz saw. Cousin Herman is here, thinking of something rotten to do to you. To the east there is a chute.  You can see an elvish sword of great antiquity, salivating hedge shears, giant nail clippers, a boomerang mail bag, an automatic stake driver, a whip cream gun, a big stick and a hairy club here.

Taken.  Cousin Herman grabs the automatic stake driver.  Your Aunt Hildegarde, strapped to the conveyor belt, is about a foot from the saw blade. "Herman, stop this silly game this instant and untie me," demands Aunt Hildegarde.

You fire the whip cream gun, blasting Herman with smooth and creamy whip cream. You toss the gun away in disgust. It sails into the chute.  Cousin Herman swings the automatic stake driver, striking you. The automatic stake driver crumbles; it was only a prop.  Your Aunt Hildegarde, strapped to the conveyor belt, is slowly moving closer to the saw blade. "Herman, that's no way to treat your cousin," admonishes Aunt Hildegarde.
take stick
Taken.  Cousin Herman grabs the boomerang mail bag.  Your Aunt Hildegarde, strapped to the conveyor belt, is now only about half a foot from the saw blade. "I'm just glad your Uncle Buddy isn't alive to see this," says Aunt Hildegarde with resign.

You give it your best, striking Herman. The big stick breaks into a hundred pieces. It was only a prop.  Cousin Herman swings the boomerang mail bag, striking you. The boomerang mail bag crumbles; it was only a prop.  Your Aunt Hildegarde, strapped to the conveyor belt, is slowly approaching the saw blade. "Herman, enough is enough. You are in big trouble, buster. Pumpkin, untie me then run and get your Uncle Buddy's belt," orders Aunt Hildegarde.

Taken.  Cousin Herman grabs the salivating hedge shears.  Your Aunt Hildegarde, strapped to the conveyor belt, is about three or four inches away from the saw blade. "Now you two stop that horseplay and get me off this contraption," demands Aunt Hildegarde.

You give it your best, striking Herman. He drops to the ground. (Hmm, guess that wasn't a prop after all.) Slowly, he starts to come to his feet. The saw blade is less than an inch from the blue gray hairs of Aunt Hildegarde's head!

You awaken in your tent, lying on the floor, with a hangover like you wouldn't believe. As you lever yourself up, you notice that there is complete silence instead of the usual morning complaints of the workers and Roboff's usual shouting. This can only mean one thing   Roboff must have finally run off on you. Panicked, you look around and see your amulet lying on the floor. At least Roboff had the sense to not trigger off your alarm. Knowing him, he also had the sense to take the emergency radio. How the megakrip are you going to get out of this one?  INHUMANE: An Infralogic Massacre.

The floor of the hole is a stone slab with a little slot in it. You can nearly smell the riches that must be buried beneath your feet!

Ok. As it slips in, the stone slab moves aside, dumping you into a pit. You look up and see the amulet falling into a machine that wraps it, addresses it to F. Roboff, and takes off on jets.  In a Pit This is a sandy pit with stone walls. You are not likely to be able to climb out. The only thing here is a note taped to the wall.
x note
"Thanks for the amulet! It only took me a few days to make this little set up. If you really want to get to the pyramid, retrace your steps back to camp after the pit caves in (which should happen soon) and open my toilet. You see, I really found the pyramid with a mass sensor when we moved in and I built my tent over it. The toilet conceals a secret passage down into the pyramid, which I have been looting for weeks. Most of the easy stuff is in my private safe in Miami by now, but I left you a few goodies. Including the gold coffin, which I never found. When you get tired of poking around you can use the emergency radio in my tent. It'll call a plane to pick you up. Have fun!     Roboff."  You hear a rumbling and look up as the sides of the pit collapse. You manage to stay on top, and you end up in the desert again.  In the Desert All you can see in any direction is sand and sunlight.

A voice speaks, resounding in your head as in a hollow gourd...  "Ah! Another of those wimpy delvers come to steal my treasure. How boring. Most of it was taken by that other guy who had the sense to avoid the nastier traps... But I am getting pretty tired of guarding what's left. I don't suppose that you have any chance of thinking your way through my traps, of course. But I'll let you try, and I won't even vaporize you when you try to leave. In fact, I'll make you a deal. If you prove to me that you are an incompetent Harry Sullivan by getting yourself killed by every single one of my deathtraps, after getting as far towards solving it as possible, then I'll give up and let you take the coffin.

Trembling, you fire the heavy arquebus. You hear its loud report over the roaring wind, yet the dark figure still approaches. The gun falls from your nerveless hands.    "You won't kill me," he says, stepping over the weapon. "Not when I am the only protection you have from Jean Lafond."    Chestnut hair, tousled by the wind, frames the tanned oval of his face. Lips curving, his eyes rake over your inadequately dressed body, the damp chemise clinging to your legs and heaving bosom, your gleaming hair. You are intensely aware of the strength of his hard seaworn body, of the deep sea blue of his eyes. And then his mouth is on yours, lips parted, demanding, and you arch into his kiss...    He presses you against him, head bent. "But who, my dear," he whispers into your hair, "will protect you from me?"  [Press RETURN or ENTER to begin.]

Pirates are boarding the Lafond Deux! The first mate hurries you into Captain Davis's cabin.    "Good, you brought the girl," Davis smirks. "She'll keep the pirates busy. She was only a tool of Lafond's, anyway. Let me just find that cof  " A man on deck screams in agony and Davis starts. "Let's go." The captain thrusts you on the bed and walks out, locking the door.    His laugh echoes. "Best get comfortable, girl. You're likely to be there for the rest of your life."  Cabin, on the bed    You are in an officer's cabin, lit by the firelight glowing through a porthole. A door is to starboard. Except for the built in bed, the room seems to have been emptied thoroughly, if hurriedly.
STAND UP
You get out of the bed.    "Cap'n Jamison! We've got 'em!" cries a rough voice.
Z
Time passes...    With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.
Z
Time passes...    Suddenly, the ship lurches to one side, throwing you off balance. A coffer slides from under the bed and bumps against your foot.    "The Falcon! The Falcon conquers!" yells someone.
GET COFFER
Taken.    "Aaieeee!" echoes a scream, followed by several grunts and thumps.
Z
Time passes...    You recognize a voice from far away, "Don't take that! Look in the cabin at the stern    you'll find some fun there!" It sounds like Davis.    Crash! You whirl around to see the door shatter, kicked by a hulking man, his twisted visage blackened with soot and blood. "Me name's Andy Crulley, and ladies learn to love me," sniggers the pirate.
HIT CRULLEY WITH COFFER
With all your strength you whack the pirate over the head with the coffer.    The pirate stumbles, dizzy. "Avast me, but ain't ye a beauty," slurs the pirate. His breath is heavy with rum.
Z
Time passes...    Crulley drags you, despite your resistance, towards him. Then suddenly he grunts, stiffens and slumps into your arms. Stunned, Crulley collapses at your feet, his eyes rolling.    A tall form blocks the shattered door, one fist still raised from striking your attacker. You catch a glimpse of the hard masculinity of his broad shoulders, the implied power in the scar that etches the stranger's jaw, and feel tremors course through your veins. Then you realize how ragged are his shirt, patched breeches and high boots. Intuitively, you understand    he is the dreaded Falcon, scourge of the sea! Alas, your fate is sealed. Resigned, you meet his sea blue eyes.
Z
Time passes...    To your surprise, the stranger bows. "Well met, my lady." His accent is cultured, his smile vibrant. "I am Captain Nicholas Jamison, known in these waters as 'The Falcon'. Your father has sent me." He chuckles at your glare of distrust. "Yes, you are like your sire. You needn't believe me untried    I carry this." He hands you a missive.    With a creak and a crash, somewhere a mast falls to the deck.
READ MISSIVE
The missive is in dear Papa's handwriting:  "Dearest child,    You are in gravest danger! Lafond is a viper with the smile of a saint, my most particular enemy. I have only now learned the depth of his deception. Should Lafond get you in his power... It is unspeakable!    I have sided with Nicholas Jamison, a sea captain and a gentleman, whose circumstances have driven him to extreme measures, even branding him a pirate. Nevertheless, I trust him and so may you.    You will be safe    but there is another for whom I fear! My horse is waiting and I ride to her rescue. Jamison will deliver this to you. Should anything happen to me, you must rely on him. I remain, with love, your father."     The pirate captain glances around the empty room, then notices the coffer in your arms. "Davis's safety box    my men were hoping I'd find it." He takes it and nudges the unconscious man on the floor, "I wonder how Crulley knew you were here? Just his bad luck? He'll be flogged when he wakes."    The pirate bows. "My lady, may I offer my protection and my ship until your father is free?"
YES
You nod tentatively.    He chuckles. "Brave lady, to trust a stranger    and a pirate. Who knows, perhaps I forged your father's signature? Keep by my side as we go to my ship    few sailors respect a lady's dignity." He helps you through the door.  Deck    The deck is an avalanche of noise and blood. Lit by roaring fires, silhouetted forms crash swords, dancing around the screaming wounded.    Out of the smoke staggers Davis, tugging a bloodied knife from the back of a pirate. Davis's eyes gleam white from a face blackened and bloody, his lips dark red as if he has been drinking blood. He turns to face you.
Z
Time passes...    Davis leaps across the deck to your side, "Free me or she dies!" he yells, jabbing a knife up to your throat. In one smooth motion, Captain Jamison draws his rapier, pulls you free and stabs. Davis slumps into a bloody heap.    Swooning, you fall into the Falcon's arms. You are dimly aware of being carried to the other ship, down a short flight of stairs, and laid gently on a soft bed. When you gather strength to look around, the Falcon has left you in peace.    You remain confined to this room, a large cupboard blocking the door. Meals are brought by a peg legged old man and eaten in silence. Of your handsome rescuer you see nothing. Slowly the days pass.  [Press RETURN or ENTER to continue.]
Z
TWO DAYS LATER...     You blear awake from a bored nap, focusing on something shiny. You discern it to be a new ring, on a strong hand in the act of tying a ribbon onto a rapier.    The man with the rapier and the ring turns, "Sorry, I tried not to wake you." You sit up as if the bed had caught fire, for this is the Falcon, changed from his rags to a finery all red velvet and white lace    and in your presence!  Captain's Quarters, on the bed    You are in the captain's quarters of the Helena Louise, where you have been trapped these past days since your "rescue" from the Lafond Deux. The room has a masculine air, with ebony panelling, a large messy table, and a rumpled bed (upon which you lie). A curtain masks the forward exit and gilded woodwork decorates the sill of the tall window looking aft.
STAND UP
You get out of the bed.
Z
Time passes...    "We have anchored off St. Sinistra," says Captain Jamison, "and I must look like a guest at Lafond's dance tonight. I will find and free your father, and then finally wreak my revenge on Lafond." He half draws his rapier from its scabbard.
Z
Time passes...    "I am sorry you have been confined down here, but I don't trust my lonely crew with such beauty. Crulley isn't the only man aboard with few principles." He smiles at you, eyes lingering, and takes your hand. You feel your color rising. "If anything goes wrong, turn to Cookie. He is quite deaf, but capable. He'll see you through."
Z
Time passes...    His look darkens. "You should know why I hate Lafond: Some years ago, as my brother and his bride sailed to a new life in Virginia, pirates struck. Their ship was boarded, looted and burned, the women taken, never to be seen again. A sailor, the one survivor, watched as a man of Lafond's description shot my brother in the back as he tried to save the women. Lafond has now bought respectability, but he shall never buy peace." Jamison straightens resolutely, bows, and departs.
N
The large cupboard is not flush against the doorsill. You squeeze through the opening between cupboard and wall.  Landing    You are on the landing of a steep stairway heading up and down. A large cupboard against the aft wall blocks the doorway to the captain's quarters.
OPEN CUPBOARD
Opened. It is a dark messy bed, set entirely within and filling the large cupboard. A cabin boy must sleep here when Jamison isn't using it. Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.

Sleeping Cupboard    The bed is softer than it looks, plumped up with fresh straw. A soft, if somewhat cramped, bunk for the tall bulk of Jamison. The cupboard opens to the fore.    Kicked into a far corner is a pile of clothes.

Z
Time passes...    You hear the door being unbarred, and Captain Jamison's startled laugh. "For a moment I thought you were Matthew, the boy who used to sleep in the cupboard. He ran off last port. How did you escape? Don't stutter, I won't lock you up again    you are safe as long as you remain below decks. I came down to give you this    my allotment from the coffer." He nods at the box in his arms.    Jamison starts to pin a jewelled brooch on your clothes, but, "Devil take it, the clasp is broken. I'll have it repaired." He folds the pretty thing into your hand. "And I meant to reassure you that if the men suddenly abandon ship, they are off to help me. Rodney will stay behind with you." He hands the coffer to you. "Please return this to my quarters for me, will you?" and walks swiftly up the stairs to the deck, barring the door a moment later.
D
Aft Hold    This is a gloomy, damp area at the bottom of the Helena Louise. To the fore there seems to be a little more light, or you can climb up some steep stairs.
N
You hear a scuffling noise ahead, and scraping up near the ceiling. You would think it was caused by rats, but for the definite curse you heard before all the movement.  Hold    Steep stairs lead up in the dimness to a canvas hatch above. Rats' scratchings counterpoint the lullaby of bilge water sloshing in the bulkheads, punctuated by footsteps slapping the deck overhead. You may move fore or aft.    Behind a high fence, decorated by a sign, are stacked the food and ammunition supplies; casks of rum, water, flour and salt meat interspersed with kegs of gunpowder and shot. A closed gate is the only way in.
N
Crew's Quarters    The crew sleeps, in shifts, in this cramped space under the forecastle. A breeze blows in on a moonbeam through a grate in the ceiling. A low doorsill is abaft.    This area must also serve as sickroom. Strewn about the floor are various powders and spills of malodorous potions. In one corner, a large blood stain indicates an amputation; in another is the smear of a leech, dropped off a bloodletting.    A small bottle has been dropped nearby.    A chipped piece of mirror sits propped on a shoulder high timber.
GET BOTTLE
Taken.    "I gotta let Lafond know 'e's comin'." Crulley stands on deck above, talking to himself, his voice floating down through a grate in the ceiling. "First, I do in the mates aboard ship, with this and t'other mischief," he grunts, and you hear a snapping noise, like a taut rope being cut. "Now to warn the boss and collect me pay. Off I go, har." He dives into the sea.

SMASH WINDOW WITH COFFER
You hurl the coffer through the window, sending it and a shower of glass into the sea. The ledge now looks deep enough to sit upon.    The end of a rope ladder blows past the window.
S
You climb onto the ledge. The ladder drifts within reach.
CLIMB ROPE
You put everything in your reticule and reach out for the ladder and over balance, tumbling from your perch. Your hand closes on a slimy hemp rung as you fly out over the waves, clinging tenuously, feet free, to the rope.  On the Ladder    You are clinging to a slimy ladder, tied to a rail of the poop deck above you. Not far from your feet, waves kiss the stern of the ship.
U
You climb up the ladder.    All air is driven out of you as the ladder slams into the stern.    The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.
U
You climb up the ladder, passing the halfway point.    Rebounding, the ladder twists you around to face the Helena Louise.
U
You climb up the ladder.    The ladder swings back towards the Helena Louise.

You heave yourself over the stern rail and sink breathless to the deck of the Helena Louise.  Poop    From this platform deck you can see the whole of the two masted ship, shadowy forms moving about here and there. A railing protects you from stepping off the deck in any direction but to the fore. A rope ladder is tied to the railing at the stern of the ship.    The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.
N
Quarterdeck    No torches are lit, or needed on this moonlit night, except in the deep shadows cast by the huge navigation wheel. Men move about to the fore, talking quietly. Under the stairs aft to the poop is a barred door.    The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.    Abaft the wheel sits a large pyramid of casks, held in place by a heavy rope.    Cannon line the deck, aimed at open sea and the island.
N
Main Deck    It is a deceptively quiet evening on the ship, the pirates singing low shanties as they repair cannon, twist ropes and sharpen daggers. The mainmast casts an inky shadow over the canvas screening the hatch. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.    The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.    Two large barrels stand near the stair to the foredeck.
EXAMINE BARRELS
The two open barrels contain rum and water, you can tell by the smell of each. They are identical but for the dark stains around the mouth of the rum barrel.
DIP RAG IN WATER
Keeping hold on the rag, you soak it with water.
OPEN HATCH
You pull a corner of canvas out of the frame. Steep stairs descend into murky darkness.
D
You glance around to see that no one is watching, and duck through the open corner of the canvas hatch.  Hold    A tiny glow of fire creeps across a stretch of floor    inside the cage full of ammunition.
THROW RAG AT FIRE
You throw the rag over the gate. Luckily, it lands directly on the burning end of the fuse. With a sputter and a sigh, the flame dies.
U
You slip lithely through the canvas hatch.  Main Deck
N
Forecastle    Higher than all but the poop deck, this end of the ship commands a good view of the island; the "crow's nest," swinging above in the heights of the foremast, would command a better. A tangled mass of rigging hangs down from the mast, like many rope ladders woven together.    Imbedded in the deck is a grated air hole to the crew's quarters below. You can go aft, or forward through a break in the ubiquitous railing.    Odors of old grease and char waft from a little shack perched behind the mast.    The reefs seem a little larger than you thought before.    You can see a mooring winch here.
EXAMINE WINCH
Made of an old barrel turning on a pole, the mooring winch is used to coil in the anchor chain. A pair of metal teeth bite the links to prevent it from dragging out; a lever is connected to the teeth. Something is written on the lever.    Your eyes are drawn to a flicker of light off the sea. Squinting, you see a man swimming to shore, moonlight flashing off his hook. A wisp of breeze brings an odor of onions and rum, and the occasional gargling chuckle, "...mischief, har...reefs."
RAISE LEVER
The metal teeth open as you raise up the lever. The anchor, released, splashes down into the sea, dragging its clanking chain. After a moment, you feel the ship pull slightly against the current. You lower the lever to prevent any more chain from spooling out.
IN
Galley    This tiny kitchen smells of old stew and yeast. A low door to starboard shows the way out.    A dagger is driven into the wooden floorboards.    An entirely bald man sits here, carving into his peg leg.    The man looks you over sharply, then winks an eye. "Hullo, boy    Sam, I'll call you. Nervous about Cap'n? He'll come to no harm. And if there is trouble, he only has to signal from that seaward winder of the house    ye can see it from the crow's nest    and we'll be there in a jiffy.

SIT IN CASK
You crawl into the cask, feeling a slab of something stuck on the bottom. From this close, you can see the line is getting frayed where it rubs against the cask.
CUT LINE WITH DAGGER
The line snaps, and the pyramid collapses into dozens of tumbling casks. Your cask is thrust into the sea, the dagger flying from your hand.    Sputtering mouthfuls of salt water, you first look around several minutes later.  Lagoon, in the cask    You are crouched in a cask on the lagoon of St. Sinistra. The jungle looms gray green in the light of the full moon.    It seems that the cask contains a slab of pork.

A skiff nods in the waves, its oars jerking around in the current.

Free of your weight, the cask bobs and spins in the current, pulled out into the lagoon. You splash after it, but it is gone.

Beach    This is a tiny beach, at the base of vine covered cliffs. To the east, the Helena Louise floats serenely on the lagoon.    Immediately north of you, a rocky staircase is hewn into the cliff.
N
Lawn    Jungle looms around this clipped lawn, a path meandering westward into the dense undergrowth. To the east is a folly entangled in blooming jasmine. The way to the beach is obscure, but visible to the southeast. Behind the folly a thorny hedge blocks the cliff view of the sea.    Music and voices float from the veranda to the north.    Two men stand whispering in the shadows. You catch an occasional word, "Davis dead... girl... Falcon on Sinistra." The men separate, the well dressed one going into the ballroom as the other slinks into the bushes. You see his face. Crulley!

Kitchen    A firepit in the floor smokes badly, fogging up the depths of this large kitchen, somehow not escaping through either the south or west doors.    A blond woman huddles alone by the fire, as if cold.    The woman smiles uncertainly, then rushes over. "Are you come from the village, boy? Dost know Lord Dimsford?" She sighs at your surprise. "So he sent you    I am his Lucy. It's been so long since I've seen him. Lafond caught me eavesdropping and now I can't leave the grounds."

Time passes...    "I haven't found Lafond's papers, I'm watched too closely. Tell Dimsford that I    I'm scared, and I want him to come get me. Give this to him    he'll recognize it." Lucy slides a garter down her leg and holds it out to you.

Foyer    A grandiose staircase splits and twists up to the next floor here, framing the entrance south to the ballroom. Long hallways lead east and west; cool night air drifts in through the front door, north of you.    The butler stands near the entrance to the ballroom.
SHOW INVITATION TO BUTLER
The butler takes the invitation. "Enjoy the dance, Miss Davis."
S
The sea of spectators parts to admit you, murmuring approval.  Ballroom    Lafond's party is well attended: you can hardly move for the crush. However, the room is oddly silent, no talk interrupting the musical efforts of the musicians to the west. Despite the heat, no one ventures south to the veranda, nor through the opening east. The foyer is north of you.    Captain Jamison moves up to you, saying, "May I have this dance?" He doesn't await an answer, sweeping you out onto the dance floor.
Z
Time passes...    "What the devil are you doing here! Lafond is a dangerous man to play with!" Jamison smiles suddenly. "Why should I complain? You are quite safe, since no one expects you here. And you are looking lovely."    The steps of the dance separate you a moment, as you twirl around and curtsey to another dancer. You glide back into the captain's arms.
Z
Time passes...    "I haven't found your father. We've long suspected a passage under the library, but I cannot find an entrance," says Jamison.    Your hands linked tightly with his and held high over your heads, a line of dancers files between you and Jamison.
Z
Time passes...    Jamison touches your hair softly.    Together you whirl around the ballroom, his arm snug around your waist, leading you gracefully, masterfully.     Nicholas's grip tenses as he nods to a bewigged man staring at you. You turn, and the man moves on.
Z
Time passes...    "If there is any trouble, and I am unable to help    a signal from an upstairs seaward window will bring my men. They can be here in moments," the Captain says.    The music ends with a flourish and you pirouette once more before curtseying to Jamison. As you move to the side of the dance floor, Nick adds, "We should separate    I'm sure I am being watched. You would be safer aboard the Helena Louise. If you slip out the veranda doors, no one will notice you leaving." He touches your hand and dissolves into the crowd.

Supper Room    One long table set across the north entrance indicates that supper was served here earlier. West of you is the ballroom.

Library    Everything in this private office is larger than life. A huge portrait decorates the north side, and black drapes mask the east wall. Bookshelves tower over a cherry desk, and a massive wooden globe squats in a corner. Music wafts distantly from the ballroom across the hall to the south.    An expensive hat is hanging on a knob.

Most of the books appear unread, their pages uncut, the spines not yet creased. All except one, "Treatise of Power" by Sir Michael Villiers.
GET TREATISE
You half tip the book out of the shelf when it snaps surprisingly back into place. There is a mysterious scraping sound from inside the wall.
GET HAT
As you lift the hat from its knob on the wall, a low vibration tingles up your legs from the floor.
PRESS ISLAND
You press the painted island, and it sinks into the wooden sea. You hear a whirr and a click and the portrait pops open. A draft of sea scented air flows in from behind it.
N
For safety's sake, you leave the hat on its knob. Best not to show that you've been wandering.    You move beyond the portrait into the flickering torchlight.  Stairwell    Cool salt air, blowing past a torch on a spiral staircase below you, ruffles your hair and circles south into the library.
D
Bottom of Stairwell    Flickering torchlight lights the bottom of a spiral staircase. A draft blows from the east; a passage leads south.
E
North Passage    A strong wet breeze blows from a low doorway to the east. A circle of light leads west. The passageway continues south.
E
Guard's Bunkroom    Once a cell, now, with the door missing, made into a guard's bunkroom, this room is distinctly uncomfortable. Gasps of air are forced through a crack in the seaward wall of the room. The way out is west of you.    A powder horn hangs on a long strap from the wall.    A canvas cot is shoved against a wall. Sitting on the cot is a large key.

Anteroom    Two exits lead from this cavernous room, north and south. The walls drip with wet, forming a huge pool on the floor.    A crocodile lies half in the pool, gazing at you, with baleful eyes, jaws wide open. Dagger sharp teeth glint in the torchlight.
EXAMINE BOTTLE
It's a small leather bottle, with a tiny label on one side. It appears to be almost empty.
READ LABEL
The label reads, "Laudanum drops. Squeeze into a glass of wine to sleep free of pain and mental anguish."
PUT LAUDANUM ON PORK
You squeeze three colorless drops onto the slab of pork. A patch of salt dissolves as the laudanum absorbs into the meat.
GIVE PORK TO CROCODILE
The crocodile snaps its jaws shut as the slab of pork disappears into its maw.
Z
Time passes...    With an inaudible creak, the crocodile's mouth opens again.
Z
Time passes...    Without warning, the crocodile relaxes, eyes closed, asleep.
S
You edge past the reptile.  Dungeon    You sense, rather than see, the rusty skeletons of old cages and torture devices that line the walls of this cavernous room. One flaming torch, high on a wall, casts mad licks of light into the darkness. Passages lead north and west. Set deep in the rocky floor is a closed trapdoor.    A pair of manacles hangs from iron chains attached high on the wall.

Cell    Hewn from dense rock, the cell is a stagnant burrow. Except for the tiniest glow of light from the torch two rooms away, it is pitch black.    As you enter, a tall bony man moves out of the darkness. "Papa," you cry, rushing into his arms.    "Why, hullo, my dear." He hugs you tightly. "Nick certainly took his time about fetching you."
GIVE GARTER TO PAPA
He smiles dreamily at a memory.    You briefly explain the current situation to your father.    "I knew Falcon would do his best to rescue me, once you were safe," he responds. "Now to rescue Lucy    Nicholas will have told you about her. You get him while I get Lucy, and the four of us will meet down at the beach. Just show me the way out of this maze, and we'll get started."

N
Anteroom    The crocodile lies half in the pool, sleeping.    Papa mutters something to himself. You hear an occasional "Zounds!"    Your father stops, smiling at the crocodile, "Hello, chum, how are you?" He bends over the creature, and scratches its bumpy snout, muttering, "Never seen you sleep like this before." It stirs to life as your father walks over to you by the north entrance. The reptile, waking, lunges after him, choking on its chain.

East Hallway
W
Foyer    The butler stands near the entrance to the ballroom.
S
The sea of spectators parts to admit you, murmuring approval.  Ballroom    A fashionably bewigged man stalks up to you and bows deeply. "Will you dance?" he asks, with a light French accent. "Not that you have much choice. If you turn me down, your father dies."
Z
Time passes...    The man's smile hardens. "You have your father's eyes. I am Lafond     I have recently become intimate with that gentleman." He slightly stresses the word "intimate."    "Now, tell me 'yes.' And remember, I am a man of my word."
Z
Time passes...    "A mistake, ma petite." Lafond gestures to a shadowy figure, who disappears into the east wing. "Say adieu to your dear Papa."
Z
Time passes...    You see Crulley come in from the east wing and beckon to Lafond. "'E's gone! The cocky crupper 'as disappeared!" Lafond looks around angrily, eyes narrowed, "Then get his compatriot. Take Falcon." Crulley runs out the front door, reappearing a moment later with help.    There is a commotion from the west. A woman screams and a man yells, "Stop, Pirate!" and Jamison is dragged out of the ballroom by two burly dragoons.    An officer quiets the guests, "This is the buccaneer who has been pirating our ships. He had the audacity to come here tonight intending to assassinate our dear governor. Do not worry, ladies, he was arrogant enough to come alone." The officer marches after his men. The dancers return to their banal conversations.    Only the painful grip Lafond has on your arm prevents you from swooning away. "Ah, so that's the way of it," he purrs, noticing your sudden pallor. "All the better for me." He pulls you unresisting into a dance.
N
"How dare you walk away!" Lafond grips your arm, so you may not leave the floor.    "So you know I am not your father's friend," Lafond says, offering a hand for the promenade. "Unfortunately, you are in my power, the Falcon is with my dragoons and I am still King of these waters." A gold ring flashes on his hand. It seems vaguely familiar.
Z
Time passes...    Lafond's eyes rake your body. "When I am ready, the butler will summon you to sup with me in my room. We will find much in common before dawn, I am sure. Then I may free your lover." Lafond bows as the dance ends, and kisses your hand. He moves to speak with the butler, then heads upstairs.

"Welcome, ma petite." Lafond bows you in.  Lafond's Bedroom    Lafond is leering, lip curled.    A lace covered table crouches beside a wing backed chair in one corner. Sitting on the table is a green goblet, a blue goblet and a flagon.    "Have some wine." Lafond pours wine into two glasses, giving a blue one to you. "Drink this down. We have a long night ahead of us." He drains his own.
DRINK WINE
You empty the blue goblet of wine.    "Good girl," he says, "Let's see more cooperation of this sort."    Suddenly, the door slams open. It is Jamison, coatless, sword bared, his shirt ripped. "Thank God I am not too late. Leave, darling, before I skewer this dog to his bedposts," he cries. The scar on his cheek gleams coldly.    With a yell, Crulley and the butler jump out of the darkness behind him. Nicholas struggles, but soon lies unconscious on the floor.    "Take him to the dungeon," Lafond says, setting down his glass. "You, butler, stay nearby. I do not wish to be disturbed again.    "Now that we are rid of that intrusion, cherie, I will change into something more comfortable. Pour me more wine." He crosses to the wardrobe removing his coat and vest, turned slightly away from you.
POUR WINE IN GREEN GOBLET
You fill the green goblet with wine.    "In private, call me Jean, or whatever endearment you choose, once I have approved it." Lafond is looking into the wardrobe.
POUR WINE IN BLUE GOBLET
You fill the blue goblet with wine.    The butler enters, laying a silver tray of cold chicken on the table. "The kitchen wench has gone, your grace. I took the liberty of fetching these myself." He bows and leaves the room.    "Sprinkle some spices on the fowl, ma petite," Lafond says, donning a long brocade robe, his back to you. "They are hot, but delicious."
PUT LAUDANUM IN BLUE GOBLET
You squeeze three colorless drops into the blue goblet. You sense Lafond hesitate, then continue primping.    "Tsk. The cook has gone too far. She shall be 'leaving us' tomorrow." Lafond adjusts the lace at his neck.
GET SPICES
You take a pinch of spices between your thumb and forefinger.    Lafond strolls to the table smiling slyly. "Which glass was mine? I seem to have forgotten." He points at the green goblet and smiles in a way that does not grant you confidence. "Is this it?"
BLOW SPICES AT LAFOND
You blow the spices off your fingertips, directly into Lafond's face. He sneezes, his eyes watering from the heat of the peppers. Reaching blindly for some wine, he instead upsets the table, shattering a glass. Lafond stumbles cursing out of the room, in search of relief.
GET TRAY
Taken.
WAVE IT IN MOONLIGHT
You scrape everything off the silver tray into the bushes below. You roll the silver tray around in the beam of moonlight till it glows silver white. After a moment, a flash of light responds from the Helena Louise.
S
You run out    into the butler's barrel chest and leering grin. You return to the bedroom, the butler following. "The governor said you were not to leave this room."
GIVE BLUE GOBLET TO BUTLER
He looks pleased. "I am rather parched, Ma'am," he says, taking and emptying the blue goblet.
Z
Time passes...    The butler seems to be having some problems stifling a yawn.
Z
Time passes...    The butler's eyes are getting heavier.
Z
Time passes...    With a grunt of anger, the butler realizes he has been drugged. He grabs the leather bottle and throws it out the shutters.    The butler collapses, head back, snoring loudly.    An eerie battle cry arises on the wind, from all sides of the house. It is drowned out a few minutes later by screams of terror from the dancers in the ballroom.

A whip cracks the air. "Flogs me, will ye, Cap'n? Taste it yourself, har." Jamison groans, half conscious. You rush in.  Dungeon    You sense, rather than see, the rusty skeletons of old cages and torture devices that line the walls of this cavernous room. One flaming torch, high on a wall, casts mad licks of light into the darkness. Passages lead north and west. Set deep in the rocky floor is an open trapdoor.    Nicholas is spread eagled against the wall, shackled in the pair of manacles.    A rapier lies in the half dark of a corner.    Crulley steps leering out of the shadows and cracks the whip near you, hopping you towards the open trapdoor. "Come to hit me agin, are ye?"
GET RAPIER
Taken. Crulley snorts, "Be careful, you might hurt yer dearie."    Crulley cracks the whip near you, hopping you towards the open trapdoor. "Ye're a tasty doxy to let slip, but no 'elp fer it."
ATTACK CRULLEY
Crulley seems more amazed than frightened of your attack, guessing correctly that you hardly know the tip from the hilt of the rapier. He steps sideways in surprise, so he stands at the edge of the trapdoor.    Crulley cracks the whip near you, hopping you towards the open trapdoor. "Leave yer honey be, wench. He'll join ye anon."
AGAIN
You flick the rapier across his chest, barely scratching him. He cries, "Avast me! Pricked by a woman!" and trips into the trapdoor.    You peer down the hole to find Crulley hanging in midair, his hook caught in the rocks a few yards down. He curses and starts to climb up the sheer slimy walls of the well.
WAKE FALCON WITH SALTS
You wave the smelling salts under Nicholas's nose. He stirs, sneezes and looks at you blearily. "How   ?" he says, bewildered. "Lafond, did he   ?" He straightens. "Darling, you are an angel, to have gone through all this and then rescue me. Your ravisher will not go unpunished." He squares his shoulders. "For my brother, his wife, and your honor, I will kill Jean Lafond."    He tugs at his chains with a wry smile. "But I must get free first. Have you the key?"
UNLOCK CHAIN WITH BROOCH
You twist the pin of the jewelled brooch in the locks, quickly freeing Nicholas.     Nick kisses you briefly, a butterfly touching your lips, then seizes his rapier and runs off to the north. Cookie calls a breathless "Hullo, Cap'n" to him as he races past.    Sounds of scraping hook against stone and curses echo out of the well.

Gallery    You are on a wide balcony overlooking the ballroom. A hallway lies to the north.    Down on the dance floor the dancers are pressed in a wide circle around Nicholas and Lafond. Cookie stands anxiously in the door to the veranda, near your father and Lucy.    A chandelier is held above the dance floor by a rope and pulley system, so that the servants can lower it to light and snuff its candles. Several feet of rope hang down from the pulley, the excess tied around the railing.    Nicholas and Lafond circle each other intently, the one breathing hard, the other casual, sword tips almost touching. Jamison has lost copious amounts of blood and is no match for Lafond, cool and competent. Rapiers click and slide. "Bad parry, Captain," Lafond says.
UNTIE ROPE
Untied. The chandelier swings slightly, dribs of hot wax spilling to the floor.    Nicholas and Lafond circle each other intently, the one breathing hard, the other casual, sword tips almost touching. Jamison has lost copious amounts of blood and is no match for Lafond, cool and competent. You hear a duellist leap forward, and swords clash, parrying.
CLIMB DOWN ROPE
"Aaieeee!" The cry comes uncalled to your lips as you swoop down from the balcony, petticoats flying, on the end of the rope.    Your timing is perfect: you slam into Lafond just as he steps into his lunge. His rapier stabs wildly, piercing Nicholas's shoulder, missing his heart. You and Lafond roll into a snowball of petticoats and brocade, dropping everything between you.                  Nicholas shouts, from far away, "Let me go! Let me deliver Lafond to a 'better' world."    "A gentleman can't kill an unconscious man!" That is Papa's voice. "And you're in no shape to continue, Nicholas. Rodney    help my daughter. I'll take Nick."    Cookie leans over you. "We must get back to the ship, Miss. Dragoons surround the house." Nicholas, injured but still arguing, is already on the veranda, half forced, half supported by your father, shadowed by Lucy. Cookie helps you to your feet and rushes after them, expecting you to follow. Lafond lies nearby, apparently unconscious.  Ballroom    Lafond, his wig awry, sprawls across the parquet floor.    You can see breeches, a shirt, a garter, a large key, a powder horn and a silver tray here.

Lawn
S
Beach    Cookie, Lucy and your father are moving towards the skiff.    Nicholas stands alone at one edge of the beach. He has a rapier.    You splash into the rising surf and pain needles up your leg. Blood swirls out from your shoe in the shallow water, flowing over a small pointed stone.
Z
Time passes...    A shot rings out over the roar of the surf. Turning, you see that Lafond stands at the top of the cliff, a pistol in each hand. "Trying to sneak out the back, cowards? You will die like your brother, Falcon. Snivelling for mercy." He hands one gun to Crulley, standing nearby, and levels the other at Jamison.
Z
Time passes...    As the gun fires, Cookie throws himself before his captain. He cries out, blood blossoming on his shoulder, and falls face first into the sand. Lucy runs to him.    Jamison yells up the cliff, brandishing his sword. "Fight like a man, Lafond. You have drawn my blood once tonight    let me draw yours."    Lafond sneers. "On one condition. If I win, your lady comes to me. You will have no need of her when you are dead."    Nicholas stiffens, glances at the dragoons on the cliff above, and turns slowly to you. He says nothing, his face hard, but his eyes tell you what you want to know. "Answer, my darling. Yes or no?"
YES
You have no breath to speak. You nod once, never taking your eyes off Nicholas Jamison.    Nicholas looks determined. "I accept. So long as my people go free if I win. Order your dragoons to obey us, then." In answer, Lafond jumps off the cliff like a huge brocaded bat to land in front of Captain Jamison. "Die then, fool!"    The pistol, spinning from Lafond's grip, drops to the sand nearby.
GET PISTOL
Taken.    Lafond immediately takes the advantage, forcing Nicholas in a retreat towards the foaming surf. But Nicholas fights hard, jaw set, ignoring his wounds. Lafond finally loses his smile.    Behind the duellists, far away atop the cliff, you notice Crulley madly reloading the pistol.
LOAD IT
You pour a lumpy stream of gunpowder mixture into the barrel of the pistol tamping it as best you can.    Suddenly the force of the duel turns, Nicholas advancing against Lafond's retreat. Their blades silently flash in the moonlight. Lafond is pressed back into the shadow of the cliff, sweat beading on his forehead. Abruptly, Jamison leaps forward, metal scrapes, and his rapier licks neatly into Lafond's ribs, like a snake slipping into its burrow. The body of the governor of St. Sinistra convulses, as in amazement, then sags dead on the sword.    Nicholas removes a gold ring from the dead man's finger, throwing his own cheap copy into the surf.    Far above him, Crulley moves down the stairs.

You step out into space, and find that you are on an invisible train which was waiting at the platform. This Ghost Train gives a piercing HOOT and then acclerates rapidly. As your eyes accustom themselves to your surroundings, you catch sight of various spectral commuters reading The Phantasmal Times and other ethereal papers. There is no sign of the ticket in spectre. After a while the train halts and you dismount to discover that...  You are in an extremely long dark east west tunnel. The ground is stony, almost as if it had been designed to carry railway tracks

You are in the manticore's lair   a large cave with an unpleasant smell of carrion. The floor is littered with the remains of creatures human and inhuman. A strange being is prowling here. Its face is like a man's, in size it is like a lion, in colour it is red. It has three rows of teeth and a long tail armed with stings. The escape routes are to the west and north

You attempt to eat the toadstone and in fact manage to lick off its outer crust, which has the taste of a boiled sweet. You discover that there is a hard centre which, when you remove it from your mouth, is really a gleaming jewel of great value

A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are awakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep.  You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R&R after your last grueling mission.  Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours.  In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals.  Off duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with.   A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotton what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

Charlie Company Barracks If the Army of Bostwin were to publish a new edition of the soldier's handbook, a picture of this barracks should be included as the example other companies should follow.  The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made.  Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place.  The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good comapny.  You can see a Pentarian Transporter here.

Your vision swims as your sight of the barracks blurs into a myriad of chaotic colors. You feel a moment of disorientation...  As you begin to materialize your eyes grow wide as you realize you're not in front of the Bank of Bostwin, where the transporter usually takes you in the city.  You're not even outdoors, you're indoors! What the hell is going on here...?  Entrance Hall Your footsteps echo loudly as you walk through this room taking in the vast expanse of its size.  The walls rise majestically upward and outward to form a huge room which, curiously, is empty.  You can't help but wonder why such a large room is needed for the straight forward task of accepting guests and visitors. To the east a wide open arch leads to what must be a library while to the north you hardly help but notice a huge, semi circular marble staircase leading up to parts unknown.  [Your score has just gone up by five points.]

Library This is a vast chamber lined floor to ceiling with bookcases filled to capacity with books.  You haven't seen such a collection of knowledge since your academy days.  A cursory glance at some bookshelves reveal several titles on various topics of magic, history, philosophy, science and a hundred other topics.  A few large tables with chairs are in the center of the room inviting anyone to make use of these impressive facilities.  The wizard Morden is here staring at you, the smallest of smiles on his face.  You can also see a copy of The Legends and Lore of Pentari here.

Spots in all the colors of the rainbow dance in front of your eyes as you feel yourself displaced...   You find yourself in the deep recesses of Vamvevmew's castle and instantly a wave of fear and depression hit you as hard as any enemy ever has.  Your hand shoots right for your sword in its scabbard on reflex and you grip the hilt so hard your knuckles whiten.

Large open archways lead east and west while a huge fireplace dominates the center of the room against the northern wall.

You can make out Morden mumbling something under his breath as he gestures towards The Dark Elf and a bolt of lightning hits Vamvevmew squarely in the chest!

Release 3 / Serial number 970904 / Inform v6.13 Library 6/5 Standard interpreter 1.0  Court Yard A good sized courtyard with an air of late British colonialism about it.  To the west, in the direction the sun is setting, is a high, grey stone wall with an ornate iron gate set into the rock.  The walls of a large stone mansion rise several stories into the chilly evening air to the east, north, and south.  In the east wall, two or three stories up, is a large window.  On top of the west wall, above and to the right of the gate, is a large squirrels nest made of sticks, twigs, and leaves.  A carpeting of old brown leaves from past winters rustle about on the ground in the breeze and drift listlessly across a cracked, stained, pale green tennis court with a rotting net.  In one corner of the court yard an impressively large oak tree casts long shadows in the dimming light.  The acorns nestled among the tree's massive branches and vividly healthy leaves are new and green.  Near the tree is a quaint looking well of crumbling stone.  A rusty tin pail rests in the grass near the ball machine.  The tennis ball launching machine sitting in one corner of the yard looks like a relic from the 1930s.

The ball bounces about the branches of the tree before falling back to the ground bellow.  A shower of shiny green acorns accompanies the ball down.

"Krill's evil must be unmade," he begins, "but to send a powerful Enchanter is ill omened. It would be ruinous to reveal oversoon our full powers." A ripple of concern spreads over the face of each Enchanter. Belboz pauses, and collects his resolve. "Have hope! This has been written by a hand far wiser than mine!"  He recites a short spell and you appear. Belboz approaches, transfixing you with his gaze, and hands you the document. The other Enchanters await his decree. "These words, written ages ago, can have only one meaning. You, a novice Enchanter with but a few simple spells in your Book, must seek out Krill, explore the Castle he has overthrown, and learn his secrets. Only then may his vast evil be lessened or, with good fortune, destroyed."  The Circle rises and intones a richly woven spell, whose many textures imbue the small, darkened chamber with warmth and hope. There is a surge of power; you are Sent.

Deserted Village This is the castle's village. Formerly, peasants lived here, going to their farm plots each day. Merchants and artisans made it a center of cultural activity. But now it's deserted. Or almost: there is smoke rising from a particularly decrepit hovel to the south. A path travels through the village from southwest to northeast, heading towards the castle, and a less used trail heads north up the mountain.
S
It is dark and smoky in here, but this is a place of great disorder, and its odor is indescribable. A pile of rags sits near a small pot which is bubbling and steaming over a tiny fire. The pile of rags sports a gnarled hand which busies itself with the noisome stew. A closer look reveals a withered crone at the other end of the hand.  The creature looks you over keenly and speaks: "I should have thought they would send someone more ... more ..." She laughs in an unsettling way. "They've all left! A great storm is brewing in the east, my friend, and all have fled before it!" She starts to chuckle. "Take this and begone!" With a wave of her hand, you find yourself reeling out of the door of the hovel, holding some sort of scroll in your hand.

READ OF UNSEEN TERROR
This legend, written in an ancient tongue, goes something like this: At one time a shapeless and formless manifestation of evil was disturbed from millenia of sleep. It was so powerful that it required the combined wisdom of the leading enchanters of that age to conquer it. The legend tells how the enchanters lured the Terror "to a recess deep within the earth" by placing there a powerful spell scroll. When it had reached the scroll, the enchanters trapped it there with a spell that encased it in the living rock. The Terror was so horrible that none would dare speak of it. A comment at the end of the narration indicates that the story is considered to be quite fanciful; no other chronicles of the age mention the Terror in any form.

Beyond the gate can be seen a small meadow and, beyond that, a white beach on a misty sea. Passages enter the castle proper to the north, east, and west.
S
Meadow This is a meadow near the sea. There is a smell of salt in the air. Only heather and thistles grow here. To the north is a gate leading into the castle. A narrow path to the southeast leads to the shore of the Sea. Your mouth is getting rather dry.
SE
Beach This is a rocky beach along a grey and lifeless sea. There is dead seaweed covering many rocks, and listless waves barely stir the flotsam and jetsam here. There are many shells, but all are broken. A narrow path to the northwest leads into a meadow. Crawling slowly along the beach is an enormous turtle, his enamelled shell shining with all the colors of the rainbow.

U
Engine Room The room is filled with noise: crashing and smashing, gurgling of water, grinding of gears, and horrible screeching of metal. Huge devices of obscure purpose provide these effects. The most notable is a huge hammer that smashes continually against the stone floor: it makes any crossing of the room a dangerous enterprise. The whole construction brings to mind the words "Infernal Machine." Far off to the southeast is another room. You can barely make out something on the floor of that room. It might be a scroll, but from here you can't tell for sure. "Pretty steep stairs for a turtle, friend. But if you say so..."
LEARN EXEX
Using your best study habits, you learn the exex spell. "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor.

TURTLE, SE AND GET SCROLL THEN NW
As the turtle starts across, he seems to set off something, for the machinery speeds up and the noise level becomes almost unbearable. Luckily, he makes it to the other side safely! The turtle sticks his head through the door across the mechanical wasteland. In his mouth is a scroll of some sort. "Crash!" A huge hammer smashes against the stone floor. The turtle fairly zips across the engine room, dodging the giant hammers and gears. Suddenly he sets off a trap, and sharp spears fly at him from all directions! But they bounce harmlessly off his shell! He avoids one last crash of a huge hammer, but even at his speed, it's a near thing! With one more burst of speed, he reaches you safely! The turtle drops a brittle scroll at your feet. "Not bad, huh?" Your stomach is starting to grumble.

N
Banquet Hall A banquet has been set here for hundreds. Long benches fill the room, each covered with finest linen and set with golden cutlery and glittering crystal. Luscious food weighs down each table, and candles light the room with a festive glow. The room can be entered by a north south corridor and a small opening to the east, from which an odd, acrid smell issues. To the north you can hear the sound of a group of low, guttural voices.
N
Junction The corridor widens here to form a large hall. To the north and south are small passages, and to the east is what appears to be an enormous spiral staircase. A passage to the west leads into a courtyard. The walls here are scarred and black, and a strange heaviness hangs in the air.
WAIT
A host of hunched and hairy shapes walk into the hall before you can do anything and, seeing you, take you in their arms and escort you to the west into a huge temple.  Temple Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor. This is the interior of a huge temple of primitive construction. A few flickering torches cast a sallow illumination over the altar, which, atop a row of stairs, is still drenched with the blood of human sacrifice. Behind the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which seems to reach towards you with dripping fangs and razor sharp talons. Two open doorways lead out of the temple to the east and west, while two wooden doors stand at the north and south. A mass of hunched figures in the temple are chanting a haunting tune. They don't seem interested in your presence.  A low noise begins behind you, and you turn to see hundreds of hunched and hairy shapes. A guttural chant issues from their throats. Near you stands a figure draped in a robe of deepest black, brandishing a vicious dagger. The chant grows louder as the robed figure approaches the altar. As the shapes grab you, the figure in black speaks: "Take the victim to the tower. I shall prepare for the sacrifice!" The figures, whose form you can barely guess, take you from here through the northern door and into a prison cell. They take your possessions from you and close the door with a crash!  Cell Everything you see is grey and lifeless, as though covered with a veil of ash. Sound is muted and there is a faint acrid odor. This is a small prison cell in the north tower of the temple. Hideous shapes can be seen through the iron barred window in the prison door. From the temple, a blood curdling chant can be heard.
OZMOO MYSELF
A huge puff of orange smoke envelops you, but you feel no different.
WAIT
Time passes...  A host of hunched and hairy shapes appear through the window. The cell door opens and you are marched solemnly to the temple and, from there, up the steps to the altar. The large, black figure approaches menacingly. He reaches into his cloak and pulls out a great, glowing dagger. He pulls you onto the altar, and with a murmur of approval from the throng, he plunges the blade into your heart!  You feel yourself filled with a strange warmth as your eyes slowly open. You are lying on the altar, a glowing dagger in your chest. You are in no pain, however. The large figure is gone, but the throng of shapes, taking no notice of your movement, is chanting in the temple below. You slowly remove the dagger from your chest, but you are not harmed. The blade shines faintly in the light of the flickering torches.  Sacrificial Altar This is the altar of the temple. Acrid smoke fills the air, and a feeling of lurking evil is all around. A low droning, just at the lowest end of your perception, causes your hair to stand on end. Behind the altar is an enormous statue of a demon which reaches toward you with dripping fangs and razor sharp talons. The fangs and talons are blood red. In the temple below is a mass of hunched figures, chanting in hideous tones.

Courtyard You are in the center of a large courtyard, which surrounds you. Everything around you is ashen and grey, and the air seems miasmic and oppressive. The dead grass seems to grab at your feet as you stand gazing around. To the east is a temple flanked by two smaller towers. Behind it can be seen the two eastern towers of the castle, shrouded in blood red fog. Between them is a dark turret, black and ominous as night. It sends dark streams of smoke curling around everything near it. From the temple can be heard a mournful chant.
W
Courtyard This is the westernmost point in a large open courtyard. The huge entrance gate to the castle looms ominously to the west. The courtyard widens as it proceeds to the east, where a large, ivy covered temple stands. On either side of the temple are small towers. Far beyond the temple, high above, are two large towers marking the corners of the castle. A squat dark turret hunches between them, blackening the sky around it. A small path leads into the castle to the south.

You try to follow the strands with your eye, but become hopelessly lost in the jumble of thousands of loops and knots. There is a spell book here. There is a loaf of bread here. There is a jug here. The jug contains:   A small quantity of water There is a battered lantern here (providing light). There is a beautiful, ornamented egg here. A scroll of old, brittle parchment is here.
CUT ROPE WITH DAGGER
At the mere touch of the magic knife, the rope gives way. Before your eyes, the strands, now moving this way, now moving that way, untangle themselves into a single strand which falls to the floor alongside the box, where it dissolves into the air without a sound.

The adventurer, proceeding cautiously, follows you. He seems to be paying particular attention to your possessions.  Guarded Door A more incongruous place than this would be difficult to believe. The room itself is nothing more than a small room at the base of the northeast tower with a narrow passageway entering from the west. Standing in front of you to the north, however, is a door surpassing anything you could have imagined. For starters, its massive lock is wrapped in a dozen six inch thick iron chains. In addition, a certain five headed monster sporting razor sharp spears for tongues seems to be imbedded within its heavy oak frame. One is almost embarrassed to mention the gargoyles spewing flame and sulphurous ash which ornament either side of the door, or the ninety seven slimy groping tentacles which taunt you ever closer to certain death. A sign, floating serenely above the door and glowing hideously in purple letters, offers the following rude understatement: "Don't Bother". There is a bedraggled and weary adventurer standing here. He is carrying a brass lantern, and a sword. He seems pleased to see you and frequently smiles in your direction. The adventurer glances around the room in a businesslike way and makes a few notes on his map. The adventurer offers to relieve you of some of your possessions.
ADVENTURER, OPEN DOOR
As you motion toward the monstrous door, the adventurer follows the imaginary line which proceeds thence from your outstretched arm.  The seemingly fearless adventurer shrugs and walks purposefully toward the door, ignoring all harm to his person in the form of knives, tentacles, and molten lead. As three buckets of the latter pour over his head, he casts you a perplexed look. "Did you try the doorknob?" he asks, as twenty seven knives delicately skewer him. Before you can answer, he reaches for one of the gargoyle heads which, by sheerest coincidence, has just flooded him in red orange flame, and turns it gently. "I think it's unlocked," he says, stoically ignoring the host of human sized rats which feed on his incinerated torso. His left hand, broken and bloodied, pulls at the gargoyle head. "I'm going on ahead!" he cries, opening a simple wooden door. Wooden door? You rub your eyes for a moment and look again as he goes through it. Yes, just a plain wooden door.

Lying on the ground is an old parchment map. Lying on the floor is a purple scroll. In one corner of the room is a badly worn pencil, inscribed with runes.

DRAW LINE FROM F TO P
A thin line now connects the two spots on the map, but the pencil point is very nearly gone. You feel that two powerful, evil forces are searching each other out. As they meet, the air lightens. Belboz appears before you. "Something has disturbed the ancient Terror. Krill himself knows this and will try to use it to his purposes. Already, they may have joined together. You must not allow the Terror to escape, or we are all doomed!" He fades into the gloom.

As you cast the spell, the brittle scroll vanishes! The stairway begins to dissolve before your eyes, leaving a circular area with exits east and west, but remarkable mainly for its absence of a floor. Indeed, you find yourself standing in midair above a deep pit with the sort of comical look which is found mainly among duped cartoon characters. Frantically, you grab for the solid bannister, dropping your heavier possessions in your desire to save yourself! But the bannister shifts and dissolves as well, leaving you grasping what appears to be an ornate scroll. You plummet downward, deeper into the pit, but the bottom is still not visible. Far ahead of you fall your former possessions.

Effortlessly, you float eastward and settle to the ground. As you enter, you realize that this is Krill's secret chamber, protected by powerful illusions now broken by your skills. Before you stands Krill, engaged in the casting of some complex and horrific magic. Krill turns to face you, surprised and annoyed by your intrusion. You have seen him before: cloaked in black, he sacrificed you at the Altar before his hoard. His yellow eyes glisten and he breathes deeply. In a voice as deep as the great caverns of the earth, he speaks: "Fool! Parlor magician! You dare to defile my chamber with your worm like presence. I shall not waste words with you. Goodbye, spell monger!" Krill snaps his fingers loudly, and a giant dragon appears, breathing gouts of flame. He moves ever closer, red eyes bulging with malice!  Warlock's Tower A dragon, spouting flame, approaches! The warlock Krill, robed in black, stands before you, in eager anticipation of your death.
GONDAR DRAGON
The dragon's flame is doused in a torrent of water as you cast the gondar spell! He disappears with a torturous scream. Krill seems to be somewhat amused.  "A fine spell, wizard worm, but your luck has ended!" With another snap of his fingers, he summons a being whose essence is evil. It has a shape which is masked by its blackness and exudes a foul, fetid odor. In its hand is a large battle axe. At a signal from Krill, it advances!
VAXUM BEING
The monster hesitates, stops, smiles, and disappears.  Krill seems to be losing patience.  "I am through playing games, carnival clown! You shall return to your Circle, but I am afraid that all the little pieces will prove hard to reassemble!" He laughs hideously and starts a guttural chant which shakes the very tower.

Broad Walk  A brooding statue of Queen Victoria faces east, where the waters of the Round Pond sparkle in the afternoon sun. Your eyes follow the crowded Broad Walk north and south until its borders are lost amid the bustle of perambulators. Small paths curve northeast and southeast, between the trees.  A cloud of pigeons fills the air! They circle overhead and congregate around a nearby bench, where an aged woman is selling bags of crumbs.  "Feed the birds! Thirty p!" Her voice quavers with heartbreak.         Broad Walk

[with the bag of crumbs]  You take a handful of crumbs out of the bag. They fall between your fingers and tumble across the ground.  As the wild birds gobble down the crumbs, a glint of red catches your eye. Frowning, you stoop down for a closer look... and gasp with astonishment!  The ruby at your feet is bigger than a walnut, with finely cut facets that sparkle with crimson fire. It must have been in the bag of crumbs.
take ruby
As you reach down to touch the ruby, a very large bird races out from behind a tree. It snatches away the ruby with its beak, zigzags through a group of tourists and disappears to the east. If you didn't know better, you'd swear that bird was a roadrunner.  "It's time!" shrieks the bird woman.  The east wind softens to a whisper and dies away.  Blowing leaves settle to the ground, and the trees are still. Then a fresh gust blows in from the west.  "Thirty p! Thirty p a bag!"

"Feed the hungry birds!"  Round Pond  Ducks and swans bob on the sparkling surface of the Round Pond. They share the water with an impressive fleet of toy boats, directed by the excited shouts of children.  Crowded paths radiate from the Pond in many directions.

Lancaster Gate  A crooked old tree shades the perambulators as they roll south down the Lancaster Walk. Shady paths lead west along an iron fence, and southwest between the trees.  The perambulator rolls to a stop.  There's an old woman under the tree, struggling to open an umbrella. The stiff west wind isn't making it easy for her.                  Lancaster Gate
examine woman
Her face is wrong.  You look a little closer and shudder to yourself. The entire left side of her head is scarred with deep red lesions, twisting her oriental features into a hideous mask. She must have been in an accident or something.  A strong gust of wind snatches the umbrella out of the old woman's hands and sweeps it into the branches of the tree.  The woman circles the tree a few times, gazing helplessly upward. That umbrella obviously means a lot to her, for a wistful tear is running down her cheek. But nobody except you seems to notice her loss.  After a few moments, the old woman dries her eyes, gives the tree a vicious little kick and shuffles away down the Lancaster Walk.

Lancaster Walk  An impressive sculpture of a horse and rider dominates this bustling intersection. The Walk continues north and south; lesser paths curve off in many directions.  A broad field of grass, meticulously manicured, extends to the east. Beyond it you can see the Long Water glittering between the trees.  A printed notice is stuck into the grass.

As your feet touch the grass you sense a strange motion around you. Looking down, you watch with horror as the grass begins to ripple and writhe with vegetable indignance!  Angry green stalks whip around your legs, pull you to the ground and drag you, kicking and screaming, back to the paved surface of the Lancaster Walk.  A chorus of offended little voices subsides as you regain your footing.

With great difficulty, and much to the amusement of passersby, you jam yourself into the unfortunate perambulator.  A young couple zooms down the Lancaster Walk on bicycles. You watch them roll across the grass and disappear into the crowd.               Lancaster Walk, in the perambulator
open umbrella
The west wind fills the umbrella the moment you open it. You and your perambulator are blown helplessly eastward onto the grass.  You zoom down a long slope, barely missing several trees and boulders. Peering over the top of the perambulator, you see the Long Water coming closer and closer. Unable to stop, and too stupid to let go of the umbrella, you bravely close your eyes and pinch your nose shut.  CRASH!                       Long Water  You're on a shady path that winds along the western shore of the Long Water. Looking south, you can see the graceful arch of a bridge, and beyond it the cool expanse of the river Serpentine.  A charming statue stands nearby.  You see a gnomon, a bag of crumbs, a small coin, a piece of paper and a broken perambulator here.  Painfully, you regain your footing and snap the umbrella shut.

The missile isn't completely motionless. It's falling very, very slowly towards the Long Water.  Your eyes follow the missile's trajectory downward, where you notice another peculiar phenomenon. It looks like a white door, suspended just above the surface of the water.  A flock of ravens glides into view! They circle over the Long Water and disappear through the open white door.  The missile continues its slow descent.

You wade into the cool, dark water.  Wading  You're standing knee deep in the Long Water, not far from the western shore. Looking east, you can see a white door hovering just above the surface.  Swans and ducks paddle through the open white door, vanishing without a trace.  The missile is only a few dozen yards above the door.           Wading

As you wade to the threshold a familiar roadrunner flutters past. The ruby in its beak gleams enticingly as it slips through the white door.  All color abruptly drains from the landscape. Trees, sky and sun flatten into a spherical shell, with you at the very center. A hissing in your ears becomes a rumble, then a roar as the walls of the shell collapse inward, faster and faster.  "This way, please."  You turn, but see no one.  "This way," the voice urges. "Be quick."  The space around you articulates. "No!" your mind shudders. "That's not a direction!"  "It's a perfectly legitimate direction," retorts the voice with cold amusement. "Now come along."

The air is filled with dragonflies, and the wood echoes with the cry of mourning doves.  The door you just stepped from opens into a toadstool of impossible size. Its broad crown towers over your head like a fleshy umbrella.  A triangular shadow inches across the ground. Its sharp point is sweeping across the toadstool.  The shadow creeps away from the toadstool, and the door in the stem swings shut with a faint creak. You stare in wonder as the door shimmers and fades from view. Meadow

You ascend the gentle hill.  Summit  The hill you've climbed lies at the southwest edge of a vast wilderness. Towering forests are broken by long tracts of wasteland, rugged plateaus and marshes shrouded in perpetual mist. A brooding sun fills the distant valleys with a sad, dusty light the color of antique brass.  A giant triangle, thousands of feet high, rises above the eastern treetops. Its vertex casts a long shadow across the wood.  As your eyes sweep the landscape, you notice more of the giant toadstools. There must be hundreds of them. Some sprout in clusters, others grow in solitude among the trees. Their numbers increase dramatically as your gaze moves westward, until the forest is choked with pale domes.

Barrow  The splinter's ghostly flicker does little to dispel the gloom of this subterranean passage. Craggy walls bend away to the north and south.  A small hole is visible in the wall.  A clatter breaks the silence! You turn, and watch helplessly as a spiked door crashes down across the south exit.  Something just moved.  You peer uneasily beyond the pool of light around the splinter. Nothing. Then, as your eyes adjust, you descry a vaguely human outline crouched against the tunnel wall.  "Barrow wight," mutters a voice in your ear.  The barrow wight studies you with its red eye.         Barrow

You find yourself being yanked out of your old trajectory, into what is obviously a collision course.  PLOOP! The soapy film bounces against the satellite. The lump of metal leaps from your grasp and fastens itself to the metal hull, anchoring the film securely.  A voice in your ear grumbles, "Where gnomon has gone before."

The white door opens wider at your touch, drawing you over the threshold.                       Platform  This narrow platform is attached to the north side of a huge steel enclosure, fifty feet high. All around you, a frozen wasteland stretches off to a horizon lined with gray mountains.

The River  You're on a lifeless strip of sand beside a great river. The water is unnaturally dark and still; ribbons of mist coil across its surface like ghostly fingers, obscuring what lies beyond.  Footpaths wander north, west and northwest. Turning south, you see a magnificent hedge growing in an unbroken wall to the river's edge.  A dark shadow lies across the ground.  As you peer across the river you notice a lone vessel gliding out of the fog.                 The River

Time passes.  The oarsman guides his dory to a soundless landing.  A puff of wind ripples the water.  Eddies of sand swirl across the shore and coalesce into ghostly figures of dust and vapor. Before you can think or move, you find yourself amid a gathering of human shades, pale and gaunt, silent as death.

The dory tips alarmingly as you climb aboard.  The oarsman glances at the burial shroud you're wearing with silent approval, and stretches out his skeletal hand expectantly.          The River, in the dory
give silver coin to oarsman
[taking the silver coin out of your pocket first]  The oarsman accepts the silver coin and nods at you solemnly.  The ghostly shades begin to converge on the dory. One by one, they step into the vessel, hand the oarsman a silver coin, and take a seat.  The oarsman pushes away from the beach.  Planes of mist close in around the dory, drawing it deeper into the gloom. The only sound is the rhythmic slurp of the oar as it plies the dark, oily water.                       A vague outline emerges beyond the helm. It slowly resolves into a spit of sand, damp and cheerless in the surrounding murk.  The oarsman swings the dory around and lands it with barely a jolt. One by one, the shades slink out of the vessel and drift across the sand like leaves on a breath of wind. Something in the oarsman's gaze compels you to follow them.  Sand Bar  At first glance, this isolated spit seems hopelessly mired in the fog blowing in off the surrounding river. But the sand looks a bit firmer to the south.  With practiced skill, the oarsman pushes his empty dory away from the shore.                       Sand Bar

Islet  It's impossible to see more than a dozen yards on this fogbound islet. The damp air makes your footsteps sound unnaturally loud as you trudge across the sand at the river's edge.  A lone toadstool has found a home at the water's edge. The white door in its stem is wide open.  A triangular shadow lies across the ground. Its sharp point rests exactly on the open door in the toadstool.  "Gnomon is an island," giggles a voice in your ear.  A roadrunner is perched on the toadstool's crown. The ruby in its beak gleams enticingly.  The lemming in the cage blinks at you.  The roadrunner gives you a curt nod of acknowledgement. Then it flutters off the toadstool, prances through the open door and disappears.         Islet

A gust of wind obscures the conversation outside for a few moments. You can pick out the words "focus," "groves" and "surveillance," but little else.
examine diagram
The diagram is a meaningless network of intersecting lines. The legend "RD=INF BL=POS ST=DET WH=GND" is scribbled across the bottom.  [Your score just went up by 3 points. The total is now 69 out of 100.]  The lemming in the cage sniffs the air inquisitively.  All at once the shack is filled with light! It seems to be coming from somewhere outside.  "Lower!" shouts one of the voices.  The light brightens to a hard, steady glare.

Tower Platform  A metal rail is all that stands between you and a hundred foot drop.  Miles of barren desert lie below, gray and still in the gathering dawn. Black roads radiate outward like the hands of a great clock.  This narrow platform opens east into a metal shack. A searchlight on the southwest horizon floods the platform in a raw white glare. A ladder is sticking up over the platform's edge.  The lemming in the cage trembles with agitation.  You hear a motor revving to life below. One of the voices barks something; there's a squeal of rubber, and a jeep appears on the south road. You watch the headlights dwindle into the distance.      Tower Platform
d
You clutch the topmost rung of the ladder with sweating palms. Fighting back vertigo, you begin to feel your way downward.  At last your foot touches a flat surface.  Tower Landing  A spiderweb of steel rises from the desert floor below, tapering up to the platform fifty feet overhead. Thick ropes and cables dangle around the ladder that continues downward.               Tower Landing
d
You step back onto the ladder and inch yourself downward.  Base of Tower  A steel tower rises overhead, black against the cloudy sky. Your eyes follow the tapered frame up the ladder, past dangling ropes and cables, to the platform at its summit.  Paved roads and instrument lines lead off into the surrounding desert.  A closed box, locked with a steel padlock, is lying across the ground nearby.  A familiar roadrunner is eyeing you from its perch on the box's lid. The ruby in its beak gleams in the early dawn.  With a skillful toss, the roadrunner deposits the ruby on the box. Then it leaps off and scampers eagerly around your feet. If you didn't know better, you'd swear it was glad to see you.

put ruby in red boot
You press the ruby into the toe of the red boot. As you watch, the red leather closes around the jewel and absorbs it like melting wax.  A shudder of ecstasy ripples up and down the length of the boot. It begins to glow with raw energy, brighter and brighter, until you shield your eyes from the glare.  When you peek again, a tiny pair of wings has sprouted out of the heel.  [Your score just went up by 1 point. The total is now 71 out of 100.]

You put one boot forward.  WHOOSH! The desert streaks past in a dizzy rush of color.  Northwest of Tower  Stubby poles draped with instrument lines follow a paved road northwest into the desert, while a dirt trail curves away to the south.

You climb into the jeep.  Jeep  Comfort was clearly not a consideration in the design of this jeep. The seat is narrow and hard, and your shin is scrunched up against a radio bolted to the floor.  Whoever was driving this jeep left it in an awful hurry. There's a wallet on the floor at your feet.           Jeep

The radio is firmly bolted to the floor of the jeep. This is probably just as well, because it's big and awkward, probably too heavy to carry. Among its many controls are an oversized dial and a toggle switch.

Assembly Room  Whoever used this room was paranoid about dirt. The floor is swept spotless, and the edges of both windows are carefully sealed with tape. A closed front door leads east, and there's an open closet door in the north wall. Other exits lead south and west.  A workbench covered with loose sheets of brown paper runs along the north wall. You see bits of wire and other debris scattered across the paper.  You turn to face an urgent noise behind you. Your heart skips a beat. Two tiny eyes, bright with hunger, black with menace, are glaring at you from only a few feet away.  You hear the noise again. It's like a pebble in an empty can.  The rattlesnake rears its wedge shaped head. It looks as if it's about to strike!  The roadrunner trots into the room and freezes. Tension mounts as snake and bird study one another, their eyes bright with familiar hatred.  Suddenly the roadrunner explodes into action! It dances around the snake, fluttering off the walls as it tries to grab the hissing reptile in its beak. But the room isn't big enough to support this style of attack; and after a few very close calls, the roadrunner abandons the fray and retreats with a squall of frustration.  The lemming sees the rattlesnake and begins to tremble.  The walkie talkie emits a burst of static.               Assembly Room

You beat a hasty retreat from the rattlesnake.  Closet  There's barely enough room to turn around in this puny closet. Its single open door is in the south wall.

You descend the ramp.  Front Yard  This patch of ground lies between the ranch house to the west, and a huge cement reservoir to the east. Well worn paths curve north and south, around the stone wall enclosing the house. Other trails skirt the reservoir on either side.  A ramp slopes up through a gap in the stone wall, ending on a raised deck.  The roadrunner struts into view.  The walkie talkie emits a burst of interference, followed by faint strains of music.

A loud, plaintive CREAK makes you draw your hand back in alarm. You hold your breath as the landing sways uncertainly for a moment, back and forth. Then everything is quiet.  Slowly, carefully, you stretch your arm towards the pair of binoculars...  CRACK! The landing tips wildly under your feet. You manage a brief, hysterical shriek...                       ... and your mouth fills with water.

Peeking around the corner, you see a large earth covered shelter immediately to the northeast. Several jeeps, manned by nervous GIs, are parked around the shelter's open entrance.  Muted voices and crackling radios can be heard inside the shelter.  A pear shaped man appears at the shelter's entrance. He strides up to one of the jeeps and taps the young driver on the shoulder. "General Groves, soldier. Take me back to Base Camp."  Ill disguised relief passes over the GI's face as the pear man clambers into the back seat. You duck behind the shed as the jeep roars past, and watch as it disappears (rather hastily) down the south road.           Behind the Shed
look through binoculars at shelter
You focus the binoculars on the shelter.  The inside of the shelter is only about twenty feet square. Every inch is crowded with technicians, tending racks filled with electrical equipment.  One technician is hunched over a stool, clutching a microphone. The tension in his grasp is reflected on every face.  As your eyes take in the maze of equipment, you notice a long wooden box, similar to the one you saw under the tower. A steel key is visible in its open padlock.

Where is that voice coming from? "This gadget would've blown New Mexico right off the map if you hadn't stopped it. Imagine the embarrassment."  A burst of static. "Minus fifteen seconds."  The space around you articulates. It's not as scary the second time.  "Of course, there's the problem of causality," continues the voice. "If Harry doesn't get his A bomb, the future that created YOU cannot occur. And you can't sabotage the test if you're never born, can you?"  The walkie talkie is fading away. "Minus ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven."  The voice chuckles amiably. "Not to worry, though. Nature doesn't know the word 'paradox.' Gotta bleed off that quantum steam somehow. Why, I wouldn't be surprised to see a good sized BANG every time they shoot off one of these gizmos. Just enough fireworks to keep the historians happy."                       Palace Gate  A tide of perambulators surges north along the crowded Broad Walk. Shaded glades stretch away to the northeast, and a hint of color marks the western edge of the Flower Walk.

The east wind makes it difficult to walk straight.  Flower Walk  Gaily colored flower beds line the walks bending north and west, filling the air with a gentle fragrance. A little path leads northwest, between the trees.  You can see a soccer ball half hidden among the blossoms.  The spires of the Albert Memorial are all too visible to the south. Passing tourists hoot with laughter at the dreadful sight; nannies hide their faces and roll quickly away.            Flower Walk

The Wabe  This grassy clearing is only twenty feet across, and perfectly circular. Paths wander off in many directions through the surrounding thicket.  A shaft of golden sunlight falls across a handsome antique sundial, erected at the exact center of the clearing.            The Wabe
examine sundial
The perimeter of the sundial is inscribed with seven curious symbols and a compass rose, with the legend "TEMPUS EDAX RERUM" emblazoned across the bottom. A triangular gnomon casts a fingerlike shadow that is creeping slowly towards the first symbol.
turn gnomon
You can feel the gnomon getting more and more wobbly as you turn it. A final twist, and it falls with a clatter onto the face of the sundial.

Broad Walk  A brooding statue of Queen Victoria faces east, where the waters of the Round Pond sparkle in the afternoon sun. Your eyes follow the crowded Broad Walk north and south until its borders are lost amid the bustle of perambulators. Small paths curve northeast and southeast, between the trees.  A cloud of pigeons fills the air! They circle overhead and congregate around a nearby bench, where an aged woman is selling bags of crumbs.  "Feed the birds! Thirty p!" Her voice quavers with heartbreak.         Broad Walk

feed birds
[with the bag of crumbs]  You take a handful of crumbs out of the bag. They fall between your fingers and tumble across the ground.  As the wild birds gobble down the crumbs, a glint of red catches your eye. Frowning, you stoop down for a closer look... and gasp with astonishment!  The ruby at your feet is bigger than a walnut, with finely cut facets that sparkle with crimson fire. It must have been in the bag of crumbs.
take ruby
As you reach down to touch the ruby, a very large bird races out from behind a tree. It snatches away the ruby with its beak, zigzags through a group of tourists and disappears to the east.  "It's time!" shrieks the bird woman.  The east wind softens to a whisper and dies away.  Blowing leaves settle to the ground, and the trees are still. Then a fresh gust blows in from the west.  "Thirty p for the starving birds!"

"Thirty p!" cries the bird woman.  Round Pond  Ducks and swans bob on the sparkling surface of the Round Pond. They share the water with an impressive fleet of toy boats, directed by the excited shouts of children.  Crowded paths radiate from the Pond in many directions.  The large bird you saw before is here! You catch a glimpse of the ruby in its beak as it races between the wheels of a perambulator and disappears to the east.           Round Pond
examine boats
The toy boats are crafted of paper and sticks. They bob freely among the wild birds, who can barely conceal their outrage.  One of the toy boats on the Round Pond catches your eye. The west wind blows it closer, and you realize that the white sails are actually wings. It's a folded paper bird, floating just within reach.

Black Lion Gate  Nannies and tourists hurry through the Lancaster Gate to join the perambulators rolling south down the Broad Walk. Less crowded paths wind east along an iron fence, and southeast between the trees.  A careless nanny has left her perambulator unattended.           Black Lion Gate

Inverness Terrace  Crowded walkways lead east and west along an iron fence. Narrow paths wander south into the Gardens.  A young boy sits nearby, listening to a pair of headphones and idly blowing soap bubbles. There's a dish full of soapy water by his side.  The perambulator rolls to a stop.  The boy dips the bubble wand in the dish and swishes it around.                Inverness Terrace

"Aow!"  The startled boy leaps backward at your approach, splashing water all over the place. "Stupid git!" he cries (in an intriguing Cockney accent). Then he retrieves the empty dish, pockets the wand and disappears between the prams, glaring at you over his shoulder.

Lancaster Gate  A crooked old tree shades the perambulators as they roll south down the Lancaster Walk. Shady paths lead west along an iron fence, and southwest between the trees.  The perambulator rolls to a stop.  There's an old woman under the tree, struggling to open an umbrella. The stiff west wind isn't making it easy for her.                  Lancaster Gate
examine woman
Her face is wrong.  You look a little closer and shudder to yourself. The entire left side of her head is scarred with deep red lesions, twisting her oriental features into a hideous mask. She must have been in an accident or something.  A strong gust of wind snatches the umbrella out of the old woman's hands and sweeps it into the branches of the tree.  The woman circles the tree a few times, gazing helplessly upward. That umbrella obviously means a lot to her, for a wistful tear is running down her cheek. But nobody except you seems to notice her loss.  After a few moments, the old woman dries her eyes, gives the tree a vicious little kick and shuffles away down the Lancaster Walk.  You stare up at the umbrella.  Passersby begin to gather, craning to see what everyone else is looking at. You hardly notice them. Even when the sirens begin to howl, and the crowd scatters like leaves in the east wind, you can't take your eyes off the umbrella swaying in the branches, back and forth.  A gentle voice whispers in your ear. "It's time."  You bend to pet the roadrunner waiting impatiently at your feet. Then you retrieve the umbrella with the soccer ball and hurry off, pushing the perambulator before you. But that slogan keeps echoing over and over in your mind...                       All prams lead to the Kensington Gardens.
